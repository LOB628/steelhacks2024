Minimum Credits:  3

This course examines the interse ctions of religion, race, and r acism. Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that re ligious identities are 829 
 often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that  religion and race are both mode rn categories rooted in post-en lightenment ideas about 
what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of  these religious and ra cial categories led to new hierarchies a nd inequalities. We 
will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion an d race, and how their i deas played a role in European imperiali sm. We will also 
investigate how the discipline of  religious studies has develop ed its analytical tools with a r acialized understa nding of reli gion. The course will 
examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and  consider the political ramifications of these examples. In par ticular, we will think 
about the impact of white suprem acy on black religion in the un ited states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, and 
contemporary Islamophobia in the U S. Finally, we will explore t he possibilities of anti-racism  through faith-based scholarship  and activism.

geographical variation, as well a s local and regional geopoliti cal factors. Historical change from the emergence of early form s of social complexity 
centered on chiefs and their fort s ' from which the regional de signation of 'Garhwali' takes its name ' through the developmen t of kingdoms and larger 
polities shows the intimate link between geography, environment  and socio-political transforma tion. Similarly, local language patterns, regional 
religious practices, musical sty les, mythology, food culture, s artorial fashion, architectural design, agricultural and transp ortation technologies and 
engineering and trade networks h ave all been shaped by the stru cture of Muntain barriers, bounded valley communities and brack eted lines of 
communication that follow river systems. Whereas the political economy of the Himalay as has been structured around agricultura l production, and 
the development of elaborate field terrace systems, there have also been subsidiary economies centered on trans-Himalayan trad e and pilgrimage as 
well as pastoral nomadism and transhumance. Since the colonial period, the Himalayas have increasingly become a place for rest , relaxation, tourism 
and adventure, and this ' along w ith further political transfor mations since Indian independence `has led to the rapid develop ment of urban areas. This 
course will provide a survey of Himalayan history, society and culture with a focus on the rela tionship among nature, the envi ronment and 
geography. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

different people is the subject matter of sociolinguistics. Som e thoughts that we habitually t hink seem illogical on reflectio n, but it seems as if our

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Is archaeology in a place like Israel-Palestine an objective sc ience? In this course , we explore how past and present are link ed as nation-states and 
religious communities utilize the archaeological record to mold  identities and to forward cer tain narratives. Our focus will b e on the major 
archaeological sites of Israel-Palestine, particularly in Jerus alem and its environs. We will e xplore the political and religi ous issues that have emerged 
from or surround their excavation . Archaeology in the Holy Land  has long been driven by a desir e to shed light on - or even au thenticate - the Bible, 
while the "exotic Orient" was explored in the 19th and early 20 th centuries through western exp editions and excavations that s erved to further 
colonial interests. These religious and political motivations p ersist even if their manifestations have shifted with time. Thr ough site tours, museum 
visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even a day participating in an archaeological excavation, stude nts will gai n direct 
experience with the places that  have aroused controversy becaus e of their problematic relations hip to biblical and other ancie nt texts and/or because 
of their location in polit ically contested space.

This course examines the interse ctions of religion, race, and r acism. Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that re ligious identities are 
often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that  religion and race are both mode rn categories rooted in post-en lightenment ideas about 
what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of  these religious and ra cial categories led to new hierarchies a nd inequalities. We 
will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion an d race, and how their i deas played a role in european imperiali sm. We will also 
investigate how the discipline of  religious studies has develop ed its analytical tools with a r acialized understa nding of reli gion. The course will 
examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and  consider the political ramifications of these examples. In par ticular, we will think 
about the impact of white suprem acy on black religion in the un ited states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and islamophobia, and 
contemporary islamophobia in the u s. Finally, we  will explore t he possibilities of anti-racism through faith-based scholarship  and activism.

ANTH 1703 - THE HISTORY OF GOD 852 
 Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
God has a history. In the earliest days of  that history, God wa s worshiped as one of a plethora of deities controlling various  spheres of cosmic activity 
or the human world. S tudents in this course will learn about th is ancient pantheon - how gods f unctioned in society and how th eir presence was 
experienced by those de voted to them. They will then trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in the 
late second millennium  BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a sm all group of absolute monotheists  based in Jerusalem in the mid -first millennium 
BCE. Students will become more s ophisticated readers of biblica l texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect  not a homogeneous 
monotheism, but rather a divers e set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polyt heism. By appropriating and rein terpreting the 
religious myths of their neighbor s, the Israelit es arrived at a  character of the divine that has proven problematic to many co ntemporary theologians, 
particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.

Minimum Credits:  3

This course deals rigorously with  historical and contemporary t opics in the study of ritual and its intersections with religio n, politics, medicine, 
disaster studies, and the study o f social relati ons in general.  From being considered periphera l to social science, ritual has  re-emerged as a 
fundamental category of human beh avior, relevant across a wide span of domains of actions. While  there is a close connection b etween ritual and 
religion, ritual action is important outside of the sphere of r eligion and is now considered f undamental to the workings of so ciety. Students in this 
course will understand how ritual  practices vary cross-cultural ly while serving basic functions . The course provides case stud ies from different areas 
and shows how theory applies to t hese cases. Instruction method s include lectures and discussion; student w ork includes presen tations, essays, and

ANTH 1709 - ACTIVIST ANTHROPOLOGY 853 
 Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Following the work of activist anthropology this  course will te ach students that "critical e ngagement brought about by activis t research is both 
necessary and productive. Such re search can contribute to trans forming the discipline by addre ssing knowledge production and w orking to 
decolonize our research process. Rather than seeking to avoid o r resolve the tensions inherent  in anthropological research on human rights, activist 
research draws them to the fore , making them a productive part of the process. Finally, activis t research allows us to merge c ultural critique with 
political action to produce knowle dge that is empirically groun ded, theoretically v aluable, and ethically viable." (Speed 2006 ). This course will teach 
students both the importance a nd value of conducting research t hat moves outside of the "ivory tower" of academia. "[A]ctivist  scholars work in 
dialogue, collaboration, allianc e with people who are strugglin g to better their lives; activist scholarship embodies a respon sibility for results that 
these "allies" can recognize as t heir own, value in their own t erms, and use as they see fit." (Hale 2008) This course will ex plore major conceptual 
work on the role and ethical responsibility of anthropological research and social justice issu es. Students will  be required t o participate in 
methodological exercises that wi ll require engagement in the Pi ttsburgh community. While simultane ously learning as a student one will also be 
producing tangible resources for  under-represente d, marginalize d and underserved communities.

The course explores Amazonian c ultural knowledge of plant and a nimal species, comparing it to s cientific knowledge, to uncover  underlying 
assumptions that constitute a sys tematic, if implicit, Amazonia n philosophy of nature. It also t eaches students how to ask key  questions and to carry 
out qualitative research on ethnob iology. Over generations of h unting and gathering Amazonian cultures gained an intimate know ledge of their 
rainforest environment, the most bio-diverse on earth. Now, mor e than ever, preservation of tha t environment depends on improv ing understanding 
and cooperation between environ mentalists and the native people s who live there; and upon integrat ing traditional Amazonian an d scientific 
knowledge of the natural world.  The course addr esses key ethnob iological questions suc h as: how do native A mazonian people cla ssify plant and 
animal species? How do they understand the extinction or the em ergence of new species? How do they understand plant and animal  behavior? How 
is plant and animal ecology believ ed to serve as a model for un derstanding human society and vi ce versa? How should human emot ions be regulated 
so as to better work with nature? What aesthetic, emotional or religious practices w ere developed to create bonds of empathy o r communication

Minimum Credits:  3

One of Anthropology's major cont ributions to the world was the concept of "Race". But after t he 1940s it was abandoned and "Cu lture" became 
Anthropology's trademark. This c ourse examines why this happene d and how our understandings of cu lture and race are connected.  This course takes 
a critical look at th e narratives and discourses in and around race and its relations hip to Anthropological and scientific tho ught. We will examine how 855 
 these discourses essentialize and naturalize bodies as well as our understandings of them. We wil l explore narratives which us e the tool and

Science and technology are integr al to contemporary societies. Understanding how science is pr oduced and how it shapes daily l ife is a crucial 
challenge for anthropologists, w ho have studied the production of scientific knowledge in labs , hospitals, field sites, and el sewhere. While early 
studies of science as a cultural practice focused primarily on the U.S. and Europe, science a nd technology are produced and co nsumed globally. 
Through analyses of case studies  of biotechnology, medicine, ge netics, conservation, agriculture, energy, climate science, and  computing around the 
world, this class will investigat e the global dynamics of scien ce and technology. Juxtaposing r eadings on different scientific  fields from around the

ANTH 1728 - GENDER AND GLOBALIZATION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Gender is a key structuring princ iple of difference and inequal ity in society, while globalization is a condition characterize d by time-space 
compression and ever-expanding connections across national boun daries. Globalization emerged out of such (and often violent) p ractices of contact 
as capitalism, colonialism, socia lism, the Cold War, and neolib eralism. This course will explore the intersection of gender an d globalization asking 
how gender shapes processes of g lobalization and how the role o f gender is shifting as  national/cultural regulatory systems ar e no longer able to 
maintain control over what is r ecognized as "normative" in the context of gender roles and gend ered practices. This course wil l examine various 
facets of the interface between gender and globalization in suc h contexts as cross-border marriages, international adoption, s ex and colonialism, 
gender and state violence, women in socialist welfare states, l abor migration, the global sex industry, queer identities and a ctivism, as well as gender 
and technology (especially, the intersection of gender inequali ty and the idea of technological enabled empowerment). The part icular historical 857 
 contexts in which we will discu ss these themes include colonial ism, the Cold War Era, post-socialism, and neoliberalism.

athletes, organizers and spectat ors? The Olympics are often des cribed as an event that brings t he people of the world together  under the auspices of 
sports' altruism. However, the Olympics are also known to incre ase sex trafficking, gentrific ation of neighborhoods, and incar ceration of targeted 
populations. Do the Olympics mean t he same thing to everyone wh o are directly impacted by it? Thi s course explores the role of  ritual and tradition

the participation of world leaders, global dignitaries, multi-n ational corporations with their financial and political sponsor ship of the Games and the 
athletes how do globa l politics and global economies come into play for local people, their ec onomies, and their social life. This course will explore

Health care systems are having t o respond to the number of comp eting challenges. The pressure s of globalization, aging populat ions, increasing 
patient demands, and the rising c osts of research  and medical t reatments are forcing us to look more critically at how healthc are is delivered to devise 
changes for the future. Changes made to health systems are ofte n based on economic and political  rationale and with many count ries currently 
experiencing significant changes  to the way in which health car e systems have historically been  funded and delivered. Students  will explore a range 
of key concepts and themes in comparative healthcare from a mul tidisciplinary perspective. They will develop critical appraisa l skills to assess the 
quality of evidence used to suppor t developments in healthcare policy and practice a nd help students to look critically at the  role that governmental 
and non-governmental organizations  play in healthcare. This cou rse will provide students will a firm grounding in key concepts  and themes in 
comparative healthcare. It adopts a multidisciplinary approach to look at key principles in epi demiology, the way in which hea lthcare systems are 
funded and delivered, and health  inequality and the social dete rminants of healthcare. Direct comparisons will be made between  the USA and UK to 
allow students to relate their learning on this course to their  own educational and healthcare settings. While this course is designed as part of a Study

ANTH 1797 - MOUNTAINS AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS 
Minimum Credits:  3

India is a social, political and  economic environment in which a broad range of South Asian medical system s have grown and dev eloped over the 
course of several years. In the past 150 years these systems ha ve been institutionalized and pr ofessionalized within the frame work of colonial and 
national medical and pub lic health policy. M any of these system s are intimately connected to the environment, and to the conce ptualization, 
categorization, production and co nsumption of natural resources . This course focuses on non-biom edical systems o f medicine: Ay urveda, Unani, 
siddha, Tibetan medicine, yoga a nd nature cure and homeopathy, as each one of these is supporte d and regulated by the governme nt of India. The 
purpose of the course is not to ev aluate the effectiveness or m edical value of these systems; it is to unde rstand how these me dical systems fit into a 
range of social, political, ecological, botanical and economic contexts. Given that a number of these medical systems are inti mately linked to 
Himalayan botanical and enviro nmental knowledge, the course wil l focus on the relationship betw een South Asian medical systems  and mountain

ANTH 1798 - RELIGION AND ECOLOGY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The Himalayas have i nspired more religious thought, given rise to more forms of religious practice and are more distinctively featured in a spectrum 
of epic religious literature, than almost any other geographic region in the world, with the possible ' but unlikely `exceptio n of a small parcel of 
relatively dry hilly ground betwee n Jerusalem and mecca. In any  case, Siddhartha Gau tham was born and ta ught in the shadow of the lower 
Himalayas, where Buddhism emerged  in the 4th century BCE. Many specific mountains, lakes and rivers, as well as the broader ge ography of the 
Himalayas ' most notably sacred rivers ' define the landscape o f Hindu mythology, pilgrimage and ritual. The practice of yoga as a metaphysical 
philosophy is intimately linked to  the idea of mystical Himalay an masters. The Western watershe d of the Punjab, including the iponymous five rivers 
' Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, RAVI and Sutlej ' is the heartland of Sikh cultural and religious ide ntity. In additi on to being a ce nter of medieval Hindu 
literary learning, Kashmir and the Western Himalayas, extending  through the Hindu Kush, have defi ned routes of exchange, commu nication, 
conversion and confrontation be tween Greeks, Persians, Buddhist  monks, and Mongol armies. More re cently ' in terms of centurie s ' Tibetan 
Buddhism has emerged out of a hist ory of development in Lhasa '  relocated to McLeod Ganj in th e early 1960s '- that combines e lements of tantra 
from the southeastern Brahmaputra  region with transmutations of  Buddhism that have taken shape  in greater china. Although not inspired by the 
Himalayas per se, Islam in South Asia has been shaped by geogra phy and the environment in speci fic ways, and the development o f a particular 
interpretation of the Koran in a small center of learning in th e town of Deobandi ' close to where the epic battle of the Bhar gava Gita is said to have 
been waged in Kurukshetra ' im plicates the geography and geopol itics of the Himalayas in the emergence of reform oriented, Ort hodox Islam.

Himalayas by examining how diffe rent groups at the village, sta te, national and international level are implicated in the poli tical ecology of the 
mountains. We will look  at the way in which  village farming com munities use natural resources, w hat kind of pressure is put on  resources as a result 
of development and population gr owth, how the mountain environm ent shapes the politics and resource distribution at the level of the state and,

The human skeleton provides the m ost direct and unchallenged ev idence for an individual's past b ehavior as the skeleton is pla stic in its response to 
stress, much the same as a soci ety responds to social and envir onmental stress. While the artifacts, architecture and features  recovered from an 
excavation leave a cultural imprint on the landscape, so too do es culture and behavior leave an imprint on the deceased. The i ndividual is not just a 
biological shell to be cleaved from its cultural context, but r ather forms a social package c ontingent upon culture during lif e and in death. We will 
examine social change and behavior  from the within geographical ly diverse funerary contexts. We will evaluate factors that may  influence the

ARC 0112 - GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE 1: PREMODERN 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course offers a global view  of architectural and urban his tory from antiquity (c. 3500 BCE ) to the early modern period (c . 1750 CE). The class is 
organized around three types of h istorical characters: traveler s, believers, and makers and chr onicles the built  environments that they created or 
imagined. Each class session will  be based around case studies that ask how a certain type of pe rson (a craftsperson, a queen,  or a monk)might have 
constructed and used their phys ical environments. Through the s emester we will also address the concept of global as an enviro nmental response by 
individuals and communities to c onnect with peopl e and places t hat were different from themselv es. Sometimes thi s happened thr ough travel and 
migration or through trade or conquest. Other times persons rem ained stationary yet imagined an d created worlds that connected  the living and dead, 
the profane and the spiritual, or the mundane and the philosoph ical. Yet other times people were forced to move as enslaved pe rsons or as nomads--
these persons too made their worlds with the resources that wer e available to them. Studying th e built environments of people who thought, lived, 
and comported themselves differently from "us" will prepare you  to live, work, and play in a wor ld increasingly marked by diff erence rather than 
homogeneity.

This course examines the art and a rchitecture of the Muslim wor ld as it developed through centuri es of adoption, adaptation, a nd innovation which 
emerged as Islam spread throughout  Eurasia, and Muslim communit ies came into contact with other  Muslim and non-Muslim societie s. Focusing on 
a number of prominent sites, build ings, and art objects, this c ourse introduces students to the  plurality of traditions and ar tistic practices labeled as 
Islamic Art and Architecture. Furthermore, students will learn about various sources of influence that came from the center an d peripheries of the 
Muslim world. Exploring these concepts will take the class on a  journey through time and space: s tarting in the 7th-century fr om the birthplace of 
Islam in the Arabian D esert, we will move through a vast territ ory that expands from southern Spa in to China, with a final sto p in 21st-century Dubai. 
All along the way, buildings and art objects will serve as snap shots that open a window into th e social, cultural, economic, a nd political life of these 
Muslim societies. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

 ARC 0116 - GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE 2: MODERN 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Major social, political and cultural changes are reflected in w ays humans build and shape their  environments. Since the Indust rial Revolution, the 
rapid transformation of regimes, t he remaking of social classes , the development of new technologies and the emergence of new methods of 
production have marked a distinc tive era of accelerating modern ization that ushered in new ways of interacting in and with the  world. In this course 
we will examine buildings and l andscapes from about 1750 CE to the present, including the develo pment of infrastructures for t ransportation, 
communication and energy productio n that transformed the ways p eople live and work, the ways pr oducts are made and distributed , the ways 
territories are planned and res ources exploited. The emergence of modern nation-states in the 19th-century and decolonization in the 20th were 
accompanied by concepts of citizenship, human rights and politi cal ideologies that required new types of buildings, cities and  borders. Global 
organizations including colonia l empires, world's fairs, sports  associations, and the United Na tions required buildings that p roject and sha pe identities 
while accommodating new publics. C ountering the effects of rele ntless modernization, the development of museums, historic pres ervation and world 
heritage redefine sites and monu ments and how we relate to past  and remote cultures. The scale and violence of global wars and  on-going regional 
conflicts necessitate temporary and improvised construction and  redefined the idea and purpose of commemorative monuments. Thr ough the lens of 
the built environment, the priorities, potentials, failures and  novelties of the modern  world emerge in all their awesome, ter rible complexity.

Cities have existed all over the world for millennia, and their  inhabitants have used these ur ban conglomerations to connect t hemselves, t heir ideas, 
and their goods to a much wider  audience - often well beyond th eir geographic and political bo undaries. Cities h ave also been sites of dramatic 
demographic changes throughout hum an history, leading to produc tive contact as well as structura l inequalities between diverse  peoples. In this 
course, students will explore how  cities all over the world and  through time have grappled with t he potentials and problems of  a growing, 
diversifying, and increasingly interconnected wor ld. We will pa y particular attention to the ci ties' heterogeneous inhabitants , their built and natural 
environments, their interconnect ivity, and their different and changing identities as "world c ities." Designed around guest le ctures by faculty from the 
Department of History of Art and  Architecture, this course will  introduce students to a wide a rray of world cities. Weekly lec tures will explore 
examples of cities across time and space, including Timbuktu, M exico City, Beijing, Chicago, Istanbul, Cairo, Paris, and other  sites; and through a 
variety of visual media, includi ng architecture, public sculptu re, photography, and film. Class sessions will be specifically devoted to comparing the 
ideas that formed these cities and how their identities and bui lt environments have changed over time.

as the fuel for the creative agency of Black individuals and co mmunities. Appropriating, intervening, and shaping the built en vironment became one 
of the many forms of Black resis tance to racism and systemic in justices. In doing so, Black ha nds and Black minds shaped the v ery fabric of 
America's landscape. Our class begins and ends in Washington DC , posing important questions ab out the hidden and overt symbols  of Black heritage

ARC 1158 - ARCHITECTURE AND ENLIGHTENMENT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course will examine architecture, city planning, interior design, and gardening in eighteen th-century Europe as the produ ct of social, industrial, 
administrative, and intellectual transformations that began to radically challenge traditional spatial configurations and conv entional approaches to 
building. In cosmopolitan centers  like London and Paris, an unp recedented explosion of print media, rapid rises in literacy, a nd the development of a 
public sphere outside official po wer structures opened debate i n the arts to previously margi nal figures. A ra nge of new voice s thus emerged that 
impacted policy decisions in the urban realm and proffered advi ce and guidance in thinking abou t aesthetics and artistic produ ction. The rise of 
science held out the possibility that cities and institutions c ould be reshaped to improve hum an welfare through better hygien e and the expansion of 
commerce. Influential new classes defined by wealth or speciali zed knowledge generated  the creation of bu ilding types for a ra nge of new activities. 
Elite domestic space in particular reflects a wholesale transfo rmation of social priorities motivated by the novel concept of privacy. Narrowly defined 
Renaissance discourse s on the arts founded exclusively on the m odel of ancient Rome collapsed under an avalanche of data gathe red in remote sites 
around the Mediterranean and thr ough contact with more far-flun g civilizations around the world.  New intellectual paradigms re configured the 
relationship between individual and nature, between modern pres ent and historical past. Conseq uently, the purpose of architect ure mutated in the 
course of the eighteenth century as a bewildering range of new possibilities for shaping building and reshaping social relatio ns were explored. Well 
before political revolution rock ed European governments and top pled traditional hierarchies, the built environment served as a  laboratory for 
experimentation and as a for um for reimagining society.

ARC 1161 - MODERNITY, MODE RNISM AND HOUSING 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course offers multiple persp ectives on architectural moder nism and modernity through the pe rspective of dwelling. We will  consider examples 
of modern architecture from the Americas, Europe, Africa, the m iddle East and Asia from the late  19th century (starting with t he debates regarding 
tenements in this country and w orking-class housing in England)  and end with the demolition of t he Pruitt-Igoe housing project s in St. Louis in 1972. 
The lens of housing w ill allow us to consider modernism in diff erent geographic contexts (East  and West); under different poli tical conditions (in the 
colonial periphery, in the heart of empire, as part of state-sp onsored redevelopment projects, and as part of the nation-build ing process in the 
developing world) and through a ra nge of theoretical vectors (i .e. The modernist house as a man ifesto for a new way of living;  the attention received 
by vernacular building traditions  and various schemes to replic ate them as part of the modern p roject; the role of post-war te chnology in prefabricated 
housing; and the role of museums , such as the MOMA and other in stitutions such as the united na tions in calcifying modernism i n various locales 
around the world). This course is designed to give students a s trong foundation in the theoretic al, aesthetic and historical e xpressions of architectural 
modernism. It is also designed t o expand the range of architect ural modernism beyond the tradit ional Euro-Ameri-centric canon to include alternative 
modernisms across global geographies. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

Pittsburgh Neighborhoods is a cour se where students learn about  people, culture, history, and c urrent issues that confront und er-represented 
communities and neighborhoods i n Pittsburgh. Throughout the sem ester, with direction from the in structor, students learn about  and employ ways to 
see, document, and interpret a neighborhood by engaging the bui lt environment, historical docume nts, and community members in storytelling. They 
approach the built environment as  a cultural product, explore p lace as a fusion of material culture and human perceptions and practices, and frame 
questions of power around the po litics of the built environment . In this class, we will employ  methods that help us transcend the realm of the visual 
and explore the experiential and ephemeral. We will learn to ob serve with all our senses, listen to community members, and doc ument life when in 
the field, and excavate and expl ore visual and textual records when in the archive. In doing so , we will adopt theories and me thodologies from 
multiple fields, including urban/architectural history, cultura l geography, anthropology, public  history, and m aterial culture  studies.

The late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century debates regardi ng the role of the arc hitectural monument as a signifier of the  past, as a container of 
memory and more importantly aut henticity, were the definitive m oment in the institutionalizati on and professionalization of ar chitectural 
preservation around the world.  In a 1903 essay titled 'The Mode rn Cult of Monuments,' art histor ian Alois Reigl claimed that w hile the creation of 
monuments (i.e. structures built t o memorialize ce rtain events or persons) had a long history th at predates modernity, the 'cu lt of the monum ent' (i.e. 
the allocation of the monument as  a unique and or iginal object in a pre-ordained historical narrative of social and cultural e volution) came about as 
recently as the nineteenth-century. It is this coupling of the advent as well as the progress of modernity along with the form alization of systems of

ARTSC 1498 - PUBLIC AND SOCIAL P OLICY IN LATIN AMERICA 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The interest in studying policy in  Latin America and the Caribb ean (LAC) has grown in recent de cades. Public policy refers to the principles and 
decisions that guide government actions. Social policy, as a co mponent of public policy, focuses on strategies and programs to  guarantee and provide 
protections for the most vulnera ble groups in a society with th e goal of achieving equality and equity. Policies are influence d and determined by 
contextual factors such as inter national trends, the social fab ric, political structu res, legal systems, interest groups, and particular situations. This 
lecture explores public and soc ial policy issues in LAC from th ree fronts/parts: the region as  a unit of study, individual cou ntries, and policy topics. 
At the beginning, the course rev iews policy theory and concepts , as well as the hist orical, societal, cu ltural, economic, deve lopment, and political 
contexts of LAC policy. The s econd front looks at policy issues  in individual LAC countries to understand specific conditions that make them 
relevant and to study policy solu tions that could serve as exam ples on policy making and implementation. T he third component e xplores policy areas 
such as health, social security, education, employment, poverty  alleviation, public a dministration, envir onment, food security , at-risk groups, and 890 
 security. The instructor will o ffer students a pool of topics t o choose from based on their fie lds of interest and will emphas ize those established in the 
Sustainable Developm ent Goals -- SDGs. In addition to the weekl y homework that could be included in their portfolios, students  will write final in-
depth case-study assignments on a policy issue in a LAC country  that could qualify as capstone p apers for a LAC Certificate. T he Public and Social 
Policy in Latin America course is mainly intended for advanced undergraduate students interested in careers in international a ffairs, government, 
policy analysis, political science , social justice organization s, or related disciplines in LAC . Some Spanish and/or Portugues e reading proficiency 
would be desirable.

While many organizations have out sourced the design of producti on systems, there is still a need to provide high quality speci fications for those 
systems. In addition, the Interne t and e-commerce explosion of the late 1990s has cr eated an even wider n eed to design corpora te websites and apps. 
Designers and developers should take into account what we know about human factors engi neering to improve t he user experience (UX). This course 
focuses on how to gather requireme nts, achieve a usable first d raft, and test and improve that draft. A half-dozen course proj ects include usability 
critiques, assessments of users' difficulties in understanding systems, and designs of forms,  screen layouts, and icons. A run ning major project in four 
parts provides a usability critique of a website or app, follow ed by empirical tests of usabil ity, followed by suggestions for  improvement, and finally, 
empirical tests of prototype scr eens (using an easy tool) that would implement improvements. A f inal presentation is a summary  of all four stages that 
is intended to convinc e management to provi de funds to make the  changes.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrenc e that provokes a variety of hum an responses. In addition to wr itings describing their 
funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterran ean region have left artistic rep resentations of death and dyin g, built tombs , and objects 
associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, ima ges, structures, and objects a llows us to bette r understand anc ient attitudes and reactions 
to death. This undergraduate lec ture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary pra ctices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and 
Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. F irst, we will explore how archaeo logists discover death-related  artifacts and how 
scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death  rituals. Ancient practices and b eliefs regarding the mummifica tion, the funeral, 
commemorative strategies, visits to the grave, and the afterlif e will be explored, and images found on sp ecific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, 
paintings) will be discussed in depth. The course will conclude  with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fe ar of the undead (zombies, 
vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial con tests and public executions), pla yed in ancient  Mediterranean c ivilizations.

CLASS 0700 - ENVIRONMENTAL CLASSICS 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The ongoing degradation and destruction of our natural environm ent, driven to a large extent by human factors, is often define d in terms of the loss 
of biodiversity, the collapse of e cosystems, and climate change . This course will focus on the attitudes and views espoused by  human agents that led 
to these phenomena. We will study the history of human relation ships with the natural environm ent in antiquity (ca. 2800 BCE- 400CE) to ask how 
we may usefully approach ancient  thinkers and ideas in a way th at allows us to gain a thorough und erstanding of our present si tuation, and to 
evaluate contemporary perspec tives and strategies. Ancient read ers of King Gilgamesh's conquest  of nature, of the Old and New Testament, and of 
the various treatises, poems, a nd stories by Gr eek and Roman wr iters like Plato, Aristotle, Pli ny, and Virgil, could not have envisaged the scale of 
human impact on the earth in the twenty-first century. Neverthe less, they were acutely aware that they existed as a part of an  ecological system. 
Trying to make sense of the env ironment in which they found the mselves led to broader questions  about our human identity and i ts role in the natural 
world. We find in the writings o f ancient thinkers many questio ns that are resurfacing in the c urrent debate on environmental ethics: To w hat extend 
does true human flourishing requi re the consumpti on of material  resources? Should a sense of com munity extend to  the land in w hich we live? What 
happens if we envisage our natur al environment as an independen t moral agent? Are we justified in controlling and dominating p arts of our 
environment, or specific types of living creatures? What are th e connections between the well-being of the land and social jus tice? We will examine 
these questions against their h istorical background and explore  strategies to negotiate current perspectives in a meaningful w ay.

CLASS 1810 - ANCIENT MEDICINE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course offers an introduction to ancient  Greek and Roman m edical thought, theory, and practi ce. Though many of their teac hings and techniques 
might seem bizarre, gross, or ev en dangerous, Hippocrates, Gale n, and their successors shaped the foundational principles of w estern medical culture 
for over a thousand years. From William Harvey's invocation of the "divine Galen" in his treatise on the circulatory system to  the citation of the 
"Hippocratic Oath" by the prosecution during the Nuremberg Tria ls, the tradition of Greek and Rom an medicine has continued to influence modern 
medicine and culture in profound  ways. A close examination of t he theories and practice of medic ine in antiquity therefore not  only deepens our 
understanding of Classical Greek, Alexandrian, and Roman cultur es, but also illuminates a vital chapter in the development of today's clinical 
practice. CLASS 1810 is a n advanced research s eminar in Classic s. To be eligible, participants should have completed at least one of the following 
courses in the Classics Departm ent at the University of Pittsbu rgh: CLASS 0010, CLASS 0020, CLASS 0032, CLASS 1210, or CLASS 1 220. Others

COMMRC 1149 - ENVIRONMENTAL RHETORIC 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The primary purpose of this cour se is to introduce upper divisi on undergraduates to some of the  most important rhetorical reso urces utilized by 
various participants in contempor ary American environmental con troversies. The first unit of the course is devoted to various historical and 
contemporary cross-cultural conceptions of the natural world an d the place of humans within what to those in our culture is ca lled the natural 
'environment.' In this unit we c ompare briefly European, Asian and native-American conceptions  and the various rhetorics used in each in the attempt 
to persuade those with differi ng views. The second unit quickly  reviews the development of American environmental rhetorics fr om the early 
European settlement of the new  world, through the colonial peri od, the early national era and in to the late 19th century, by w hich time many of the 
signal concepts and rhetorical r esources which c ontinue to info rm 21st century American discou rse on wildness, nature, environ ment and ecology 
were first elaborated. Unit three examines some of the most sig nificant and contention environm ental disputes of the 20th cent ury; including 
wilderness preservation, the hum an causes of the great 'dust bo wl' devastation of farmland in the 1930s, the sudden relevance of the old science of 
'ecology,' the huge influence of Rachel Carson's rhetorical mas terpiece, silent spring, exposin g the dangers of wide scale use  of the pesticide DDT, 
and the growth of new movements against nuclear, chemical, and biological contamination as well as air, water, oceanic, solid waste, and many other 
forms of pollution, including eve n the at first ridiculed dange rs of noise and light pollution. U nit four then looks at the en vironmental movement as it 
becomes truly global, beginning sy mbolically with the first 'ea rth day' activities, protests an d teach-ins in 1970, which have  continued annually to this 
day. Unit five will look at the acrimonious 1980s dispute betwe en the new 'deep ecology' movemen t and the more mainstream envi ronmental 
lobbying organizations like the si erra club, the nature conserv ancy etc. which focus primarily  on lobbying congress for enviro nmental reforms, rather 
than advocating a complete revolution in the way each individua l human lives. Unit six will the n treat some of the many enormo us new 
environmental challenges of the  21st century, from still unrest rained global warming, to ozone depletion, to the depletion of fish stocks, to 
deforestation and desertificat ion, to increasing human populati on, to widespread species extinc tions, to the depletion of natu ral resources, from oil, to 
arable land, and even potable wa ter, and so forth . Students sho uld leave the course with a ri gorous understanding of where con temporary 
environmental rhetori cal resources come from and how they conti nue to operate in all manner of c ontemporary environmental and ecological 
controversies.

will, used for purposes that th e user did not expect, revealed to entities other than those approved by the user, or used to i nfer additional information 
that the user did not  intend to reveal. In this course, student s will learn to reason about what information is revealed throu gh the use of computer 
systems. They will study several d ifferent scenarios in which i nformation sharing is either una voidable or to so me extent desi rable, and discuss the

In this course, we look at gender ed dimensions of education and  development in international contexts. We look cross-culturall y, across space, and 
across "development" continua and paradigms. We examine gendere d issues through three modules that represen t diverse levels of  educational 
practice - basic education, highe r education, and non-formal an d informal education. In order to provide focus in this rich an d complex field, we hone 
in on key policy orientations tha t build sequentially, starting  with the most fundamental issues  of access and equity, continu ing with capacity 
building, and extending to susta inability and creating social c hange. Since this class is femin ist by design, we explicitly li nk policy with agency, 
theory with advocacy, and reflection with action. Each course s ection also contains a strand on advocacy and action, through w hich students are able 
to create a synthesis of module  lessons through a personal, ana lytical standpoint piece.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
What is flexible device manufacturing? What is green manufactur ing? What is cybermanufacturing?  Importantly, how do these emer ging "types" of 
manufacturing differ from tradi tional manufacturing? It is impo rtant to recognize tha t global manufacturi ng is undergoing majo r transformations 
nowadays. The confluence of new advanced materials, emerging fa brication technologies, and connected cyber-physical systems is  creating 
paradigm shifts for the ways pro ducts are conceived, made, dist ributed, used, and disposed. In the ever-increasing competition  of "making things" of 
value to consumers, many industr ies are now reinventing themsel ves to cope with this new reality. This class covers the fundam entals behind major 
global trends, and their implica tion for the future of manufact uring from an engineering perspe ctive. Topics cov ered include t he following: (1) How 
the need for flexible and wear able devices is driving innovatio n in new materials and fabrica tion processes beyond the traditi onal microfabrication 
techniques adopted in the semico nductor industry. (2) How prote in-based materials, degradable polymers, and novel recycling te chnologies are 
paving the way for more sustainab le manufacturing of consumer p roducts. (3) How data analytics an d internet of things (IoT) te chnologies are 
enabling a new generation of digit al manufacturing systems refe rred to as Industry 4.0, and beyond.

ENGR 1080 - LEAN LAUNCHPAD: EVID ENCE-BASED ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
Minimum Credits:  3

Conventional wisdom regarding st arting a business is dead wrong . This conclusion led Steve Blank and others to develop the lea n startup method, an 
approach for systematically expl oring the business model needed  to make an idea into a success . In Blank's own words: 'existin g companies execute a 
business model, startups search f or one. This distinction shape s the lean definition of a startup: a temporary organization de signed to search for a 
repeatable and scalable  business model.' In  this course, we dis cuss the basic elements of the  lean startup method and apply th em to the domain of 
engineering product and customer  development. Students are expe cted to come to the class with their own idea(s) for potential product offering(s), 
which they will then test using the lean startup approach over the course of the term.

The course is designed to study the environmental impact of coa l, stone, and other mining opera tion and examine the engineerin g controls used to 
mitigate these impacts. The examination begins with the explora tion and permitting of the mine site, emphasizi ng important env ironmental issues. 
Next, the impacts of active mini ng on land and water use are ou tlined. Most of these issues are related to subsidence impactin g surface structures and 
water movement both at the surface and und erground. To complete  the mine's life cycle, closure and remediation issues are inve stigated. Lastly, a 
detailed examination of the i ssues associated with abandoned mi ned-lands, i.e. Acid- mine drainage, mass-wasting, fires, etc., Are studied. 
Throughout the course, engineeri ng controls that focus on mitig ating the environmental impacts of mining are acknowledged and assessed.

ENGCMP 0212 - SEMINAR IN COMPOSI TION: TOPICS IN DIVERSITY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Seminar in Composition is a cours e taken by alm ost all undergra duates at the University of P ittsburgh. Its goals are to help y ou engage in writing as a 
creative, disciplined form of  critical inquiry ; compose thought fully crafted essays that positio n your ideas among other views ; write with precision, 
nuance, and awareness of textual  conventions; and revise your w riting by rethinking the assumptio ns, aims, and effects of prio r drafts. This seminar 
will include readings and writing activities that explore conce pts and practices rela ting to diversity and its established and  emerging definitions. Your 
section may address, for example, issues like race, gender, sex uality, ethnicity, religious difference, differences in abiliti es, and economic disparities. 
You can expect to iden tify and analyze assu mptions about differ ence, study how texts can generat e and perpetuate such assumpti ons, and explore the 
consequences of such assumption s. You will also learn how to re search and compose with attention to difference. We will read a  challenging set of 
essays to frame our work in the  course, but the k ey texts will be your own writings and those of  your classmates. Your focus o n student writing will 
be detailed: you will work close ly with the papers that you and  your fellow classmates have written, trying to think of ways t o make them more 
precise, interesting, organized, complex, and reflexive. This c ourse is an opportunity to learn how to use reading (published texts, the papers of your 
classmates, and readers' comme nts) to help you work on your wri ting and how to use writing to help you strengthen ways of read ing and thinking. 
Like other seminars in composi tion, this introductory course of fers students opportunities to imp rove as writers by developing  their understanding of 
how they and others use writing to interpret and share experien ce, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. This  seminar will include 
readings and writing activities that explore concepts and pract ices relating to diversity and its established and emerging def initions. Your section may 
address, for example, issues like race, gender, sexuality, ethn icity, religious difference, differences in abilities, and econ omic disparities. You can 
expect to identify and analyze assumptions about difference, st udy how texts can generate and pe rpetuate such assumptions, and  explore the 
consequences of such assumption s. You will also learn how to re search and compose with attention to difference.

ENGCMP 0213 - SEMINAR IN COMPOSI TION: DISABILITY STUDIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This composition course will engag e students in formal and info rmal writing that fosters critical thinking on the topic of dis ability. Drawing on 
theoretical writing in disability  studies as well as creative a nd critical literature by writers with disabilities, the course  will introduce s tudents to ways 
of identifying and questioning certain sociocultural assumption s about ability, sensory experien ces of the world, and mental a s well as physical 
health. The nature of the writing assignments and writing proce sses will vary in order to rec ognize a diversity of abilities a nd ways of thinking. In 
exploring disability a s a diversity issue,  the course aims at i ntersectionality, a concept in troduced in 1989 by legal scholar  Kimberlé Crenshaw. 
Intersectionality is the recogniti on that none of us can be sai d to inhabit a single identity; for example, our racial identit y is always complicated by 
our socioeconomic class, gender a nd sexuality, as well as by ou r identities as abled/disabled. Anyone may become disabled at a ny point in time, and 
according to the Center for Disease Control, 61 million America ns identify as disabled, so it's safe to say that disability im pacts every identity.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Sport is a ripe avenue for publ ic meaning-making, as athletes h ave used their platforms to bri ng awareness to various societal  issues throughout 
history. In US contexts, athlet es, like Serena Williams, Muhamm ad Ali, Simone Biles, Lebron James, Megan Rapinoe, Colin Kaeper nick, John 
Carlos, and Tommie S mith (among many others), have taken public  stands against various injustices. The ways in which sports da ta and narratives-in 
journalism, on social media, in  film, or local communities, for  example-are crafted also make m eaning for a variety of genres and purposes. Thinking 
deeply about this subj ect offers participant s ways to construct  and deconstruct sport-writing to  understand how these messages  are made. In this 
course, we will enga ge with public writi ng about sports--both b y and about athle tes. Participants will not only study historie s of sports-writing but 
will also consider how today's t echnologies can shape represent ations of the public a thlete. We will read and write in a varie ty of rhetorical, 1224 
 journalistic, informational, creative, and research-based genre s, while thinking carefully about  the role of sports and athlet es in shaping notions of 
racial, gender, and class-based identities.

with writing can be engaging, e xciting, and somet hing we can wo rk on together. We will be going  over a handful of statistical concepts in the second 
half of the course so we can write about them, but the emphasis  here will ultimately be on prof iciency for the purposes of a g iven concepts use in 
writing. By the end of the course , both traditional and quantit ative literacy will be improved to  serve student development as  competent quantitative 
writers and readers in future PPW courses, courses across diffe rent majors at Pitt, in their writing as professionals, and as more discerning consumers 
and producers of knowledge  as global citizens.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course provides students wi th a foundation for using writi ng to understand, apply,  and critically engag e with key concept s and histories that 
have been crucial to the experiences of people with disabilitie s, and perceptions and treatment of those with disabilities. St udents can expect to 
explore and write theoretical pieces, first-person accounts, an d representations of people with disabilities. They will learn various models of 
understanding and discussing disa bility (including the social, medical, individual m odel, and identity mod els) and the histori es that have shaped the 
lives, experiences, and percept ions of people with disabilities . Students in the course will ha ve the opportunity to compose r hetorical analyses of 
popular, public, and professional representations of disability . Historically, disability has b een viewed as a deficiency or d efect through the lens of 
religious and, most prominently, medical discourse s, locating d isability within an individual's body and mind. Seeing disabili ty as a problem to be 
solved has resulted in significant barriers to access and repre sentation for people with disab ilities within all areas of the public sphere. Students will 1227 
 develop their own written critica l inquiries into concepts such  as normalcy, disability, and barriers to access (including phy sical, social, attitudinal, 
legal barriers). This course will  not only offer critical inter rogations of disability as a construct, but also center the liv es and experiences of those with 
disabilities, viewing disability a s a locus of identity and cul ture. To that end, st udents will watch documentaries and televi sion media, and read 
memoir, personal essays, and poetr y that present the pride, str uggles, and everyday experiences  of people with disabilities. S tudents will also study 
the Disability Rights Movement and inquiries into identity poli tics as related to disability as an identity category. The cour se will invite students to 
use composition to increase ac cessibility for those with disabi lities and to consider the potentials and limitations of univer sal design.

ENGFLM 0712 - CRITICAL MAKING 1241 
 Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The Maker movement is an emerging social and media form that is  at once highly networked and pos t-digital. Making is situated at the intersection 
of social media, the online gift  economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with  one's physical environment. Dra wing on open source 
ideals and innovation structures - the free sharing of code to e nable collaborative development - making has become an attempt to democratize 
material culture through networke d access to tools. MakerSpaces  and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materia lize the virtual gift 
economy of the Internet. In this  course we will en gage the inte llectual and practical roots of t his new medial and social form  and engage in our own 
critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will b egin by looking at the history and philosophy of open 
source software development, and then the political, social, cu ltural, and technological develop ments that have together given  rise to critical maker 
culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning , modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printin g assignments, students 
will form groups and develop coll aborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a t opic of your choice and 
in a medium of your choi ce. The aim of this course is to "close  the circuit" between creative conceptual production, social ne tworking, and 
materialized object r elationships. Critica l making is about cri tically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. B y the end of the 
semester, you will become a critical maker! This is a Critical Studies course with Production el ements and counts for Category  III towards the Film

ENGFLM 0812 - MEDIA/ECOLOGY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
From the late twentieth century t o the present, ecology as a sc ientific discipline and set of cultural narratives has risen to  the forefront of knowledge 
production as a way to study and understand complex biological systems, their environments, and their internal dynamics. Durin g the same period, 
media systems have grown expone ntially in complexity until they  too have begun to exhibit some o f the behaviors of ecological systems, including 
self-organization, feedback, evolution, and emergent properties . The term "media ecology" captu res both this new, nonlinear sy stems approach to 
understanding media its elf as well as the i ntersection between natural ecosystems and the tec hnological assemblages with which  they are intertwined. 
This course will explore both me dia that interface with natural  ecosystems and works that engage contemporary media systems at  different scales. 
The secret life of information,  contagious media, and the post- natural ecologies of our present  and future will challenge us t o conceive of Media and 
Ecology as a single coupled syste m: the emblem of our contempor ary environment. Students will  have the option to produce colla borative media 
projects that explore the themes of the course. These can take the form of simulations, games, network graphing, film or video  projects, local 
ecosystem analysis and/or visua lization, or the mapping and ana lysis of a media ecosystem that interfaces with the environment . This is a Critical

ENGFLM 1226 - EASTERN EUROPE AN COMMUNISM AT THE MOVIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
After the 1917 revolution in Russi a, Lenin famously said: "to u s film is the most important of al l the arts." Communists were to use cinema for 
propaganda purposes, in order to carry out massive state-wide c ampaigns aiming to bring radical s ocial change. However, Soviet  avant-garde 
filmmakers were also concerned with revolutionizing filmmaking itself. Some three decades after Lenin's remarks, the leaders o f the countries of 
Eastern Europe which had become "Soviet satellites" after World  War II, attempted to use censorship and control over the arts and cinema to produce 
effective propaganda for their own political campaigns. Writers , artists, and filmmakers were coveted allies of these new comm unist regimes that 
came to power in the 1940s. Again, however, f ilmmakers and acto rs did not always toe the Party line. Some were able to use fil m to craft complex 
works with subtle messages portray ing aspects of daily life as it was experienced by ordinary p eople under the new regimes. Fi lms that we will watch 
and analyze, released in Hungary , Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia in the decades  before the fall of communism in 1989 managed 
to depict, evoke, and criticize "really existing communism." Th is course will trace the history of East European communism and  of East European 
film-making from 1944 to 1990, ac quainting students with exampl es from an exceptional body of cin ematographic work together wi th the broad

Cinema has enjoyed a close relat ionship with lit erature, borrow ing from literary source texts and forms. Yet this relationship  is not uncomplicated, 
nor is it unidirectional: the cinema offers new possibilities f or novelistic source texts, pos es interesting problems for lite rature's authors and readers 
alike and provokes a reconsiderat ion of age-old debates of the divide between words and images. Thus this course  examines film 's convergence with, 
and divergence from, literary forms. Poised at the intersection  of the study of film and the study of literature, it enables u s to explore what is most

ENGLIT 0648 - NARRATIVE AND GRAPHIC PERSPECTIVES IN HEALTH HUMA NITIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course emphasizes the narra ting and understanding of diffe rence as central to the education of those engaged in/with the healthcare field. 
Students will examine how narrativ es of neuro-diversity; gender  barriers; racial inequities in education and health services, are all crucial issues for 
providers and receivers of medi cal care. By studying literature  about medicine/the health professions from diverse perspective s, students in the 
course will learn to "observe, pa rse, appreciate, critique, and  creatively reimagine points of contact between individuals in healthcare sphere." 
Through a series of readings inc luding Paul Kalanithi's When Br eath Becomes Air; and a mixed-media biography such as Lauren Re dniss's 
Radioactive; Damon Tweedy's Black  Man in a White Coat; Danielle  Ofri's What Patient Say, What Do ctors Hear; and the Graphic Me dicine 
Manifesto, this course will introduce students to an exciting n ew field that erases the boundari es between authoritative "medi cal discourse" and what 
is commonly assumed to be a no n-serious genre, graphic novel/co mics; between physicians and patie nts' modes of accessing infor mation and 
exchanging knowledge; between aca demic "essays" a nd Critical Cr eative Work that engages rigor ously with knowledge and experien ce. Through 
this series of readings, student s will consider issues such as:  What kind of health practitioner do you wish to be? What model s exist for asking 
important questions about the n ature of human empathy though kn owledge of Other's stories? and how is awareness of identity an d difference 
nurtured in the education of the  healthcare providers? How can you begin to articulate or repre sent your own in rigorous but c reative ways?

relevant scientific and medical discourses, as well as locating  it in competing literary critic ism traditions in queer theory and transgender studies. The 
weekly course meetings  will revolve around discussion of key wo rks in queer and transgender liter ature, paired alternately wit h important literary 
criticism and primary sources. C lassroom discussion and in-clas s writing assignments will focus on building these historicist and critical skills in 
sequence, so as to prep are students for their main assignment s equence, which asks them to apply the skills they are learning to generate their own 
contributions to debates in c riticism about t he proper boundari es between queer and transgender identities.

fantasy. The fairy tradition encompasses vital cultural questio ns about the work of imagination , magic, and vision in our unde rstanding of ourselves 
and the world around us. Either e lusive or non-existent, depend ing on perspective, fairy lore e vokes issues related to: the re liability of witness and of 
the senses; privileged and discou nted perception; the interplay  of the imagination and knowledge ; and the role of cultural aut hority. Students will

ENGLIT 0732 - POST-DIGITAL GAMING 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The current moment is frequently referred to as the "golden age  of tabletop games" (a category that encompasses board games, c ard games, and role 
playing games), marked by significant innovation in the form, a n explosion of tabletop game popularity, and a significant onli ne culture devoted to 
this most offline of media. Why  are analog games flourishing as  never before in a culture suppos edly saturated by and enamored  with the digital? 
How do these games function as emergent narrative structures? H ow do they respond to digital m odalities, either by implicitly opposing their 
aesthetics and informatics or i ncorporating various digital dyn amics and remediating them into offline, tactile form? This cou rse will examine the 
narrative, social, and material dynamics of games that have eme rged within the era of ubiquitous digital media, yet employ ana log elements as either 
a rejection of the dig ital, a cr itical response to  it, or an ex ploration of the hybrid potential s of analog-digital systems. W e will also ex amine hybrid 
games that incorporate both digita l and analog ele ments, such a s early video games that promiscu ously combined the two, or mor e recent digital 
games that "spill into" analog sp ace and incorporate analog dyn amics into their hybrid simulations. How do these games frame t he relationship 
between the analog and the digi tal, the body and code, open sys tems and closed worlds? In the course of this adventure through  narrative, emergent 
social dynamics, and simulated worlds, we' ll play innovative ta bletop games from recent years, some older games that have been  remediated in 
various ways, early video games , and recent i nnovations in hybr id analog-digital game s. We'll consider how the narrative archi tectures and gameplay 
mechanics employed by these games enable emergent storytelling and critical simulation at the same time, reflecting on and pro bing identity, social 
dynamics, traumatic his tories, and ethics in an era of digital media. Game design will play a significant role in a series of assignments. No prior 
gaming or game design experience is required.

ENGLIT 0812 - MEDIA/ECOLOGY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
From the late twentieth century t o the present, ecology as a sc ientific discipline and set of cultural narratives has risen to  the forefront of knowledge 
production as a way to study and understand complex biological systems, their environments, and their internal dynamics. Durin g the same period, 
media systems have grown expone ntially in complexity until they  too have begun to exhibit some o f the behaviors of ecological systems, including 
self-organization, feedback, evolution, and emergent properties . The term "media ecology" captu res both this new, nonlinear sy stems approach to 
understanding media its elf as well as the i ntersection between natural ecosystems and the tec hnological assemblages with which  they are intertwined. 
This course will explore both me dia that interface with natural  ecosystems and works that engage contemporary media systems at  different scales. 
The secret life of information,  contagious media, and the post- natural ecologies of our present  and future will challenge us t o conceive of Media and 
Ecology as a single coupled syste m: the emblem of our contempor ary environment. Students will  have the option to produce colla borative media 
projects that explore the themes of the course. These can take the form of simulations, games, network graphing, film or video  projects, local 
ecosystem analysis and/or visua lization, or the mapping and ana lysis of a media ecosystem that interfaces with the environment .

This course studies heroism as a gendered concept as it has evo lved over time. The h ero is a commonly unde rstood archetype acr oss genres but is 
most often associated with mascu linity. This course seeks to de fine, authenticate, and analyze the female hero as a powerful f igure in her own right. 
This course will take into account the tropes of classical hero ism but consider modern and cont emporary texts in which the ima ge of the hero is 
redefined in line with the concept of the "female hero." Issues  we will investigate include: the role of the masculine gaze in  the construction of female 
heroes; feminist versions of he roism and strength; and the role  race, class, and gender play in the making of a h ero. We will also consider the ways 
that the female hero inflects or alters traditional feminine ro les. And we will consider how the  binary constructions of mascu linity and femininity are 
impacted by stories with female heroes. Through analysis of fic tion, film, and criticism, we will begin to define the female h ero.

ENGLIT 0880 - SHAKESPEARE  AND SOCIAL JUSTICE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
When Shakespeare's King Lear fin ally turns his attention to the  plight of "poor naked wretches"  who have no clothing to protec t them from a 
"pitiless" storm, he realizes he has taken "too little care" of  human suffering in his kingdom. Departing from scenes such as this one, this course 
explores the work of artists a nd critics who have used Shakespe are's plays to confront a range  of social injustices, including  US persecution of Native 
Americans, the legacies of white settler colonialism across the  globe, and intimate partner violence. Examining adaptations, r emediations, and 
appropriations of Shakespeare pl ays, such as Toni Morrison's De sdemona or Aimé Césaire's A Tempest, students will be invited t o consider what 1280 
 Shakespeare signifies in different cultural contexts and to exa mine related contests of cultural  authority and ownership. Focu sing on scholarship, 
performances, poetry, and art by  people from various marginaliz ed groups, students will explore the histories and futures of B lack Shakespeare, 
Indigenous Shakespeare, Trans Sha kespeare, Chicano Shakespeare,  and many others. Several short writing assignments will build students' skills in a 
range of critical and creative practices that can contribute to  social justice and diversity: archival research, critical fabu lation, social network 
mapping, oppositional reading, com parative analys is of two or m ore productions, and pe rsonal reflection.

 ENGLIT 1009 - J.R.R. TOLKIEN AND COUNTERCULTURE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course studies the persona , work, and cri tical and popular  reception of J.R.R. Tolkien ( 1892-1973) from his initial publi cation of The Hobbit in 
1937 through today. In the 1960s a nd '70s, people were scribbli ng "Frodo Lives" on subway walls  and getting marr ied dressed li ke Aragorn and 
Arwen. Less than half a century later, The Lord of the Rings re peatedly beat out the Bible as  "best-loved" book in British pol ls, and Peter Jackson's 
adaptations made history both fo r their box-office earnings and  for their groundbreaking contributions to film-making. Widely recognized as the 
father of modern fantasy and tout ed as the "Author of the [Twen tieth] Century" by scholars, Tol kien continues to exert a panor amic influence on 
culture, particularly in his ability to speak to and for the ma rginalized. From Comic Con to Elder Scrolls to Game of Thrones,  his sub-creation of 
Middle-earth embodies and fuels " nerd" culture now just as it d id for the hippies of the previous century. Yet, Tolkien " war veteran, Oxford 
professor of Medieval languages and literature , devout Catholic  " was a man of his time and quite conserva tive, at least publi cly. While he famously 
said that his wife "should be sa tisfied by devotion to her chil dren" and not "enter the intellectual side of life," the female  characters in his stories, 
while small in number, are arguably great in power, assertivene ss, and heroism. Tolkien's writi ng argues for the importance of  a community where all 
cultures coexist: Elves, Dwarfs, Men, Hobbits go to war against  Sauron and the "One Ring" desig ned to "rule them all." In this  course we will read 
Tolkien's major works, The Hobb it and The Lord of the Rings in their entirety, as well as excerpts from what he considered to be his master work, 
The Silmarillion. We will explore Tolkien materials housed in S pecial Collections at Hillman Library and online. Our reading l ist will include 
reviews and scholarship on Tolki en's life and work, as well as on the ways in which his mythol ogy continues to resonate and be  reimagined in the 
twenty-first century. Ultimately , we will analyze the relations hip between Tolkien and the count erculture as a way of understa nding the ways in 
which myth, fantasy, and literatu re more broadly represent, sha pe, and interrogate complex social and political systems.

Minimum Credits:  3

The English language and its literatures are in constant flux, but this was especially true in medieval england as waves of fo reign invaders and 
immigrants shaped the language, and political, religious, and m ercantile contact with other regi ons of Europe contributed new aesthetic and poetic 
ideals. Beginning with old Englis h riddles, this course helps y ou discover the linguistic and lit erary DNA of English. You wil l discover the multiple 
"Englishes" and other languages th at remain presen t in modern E nglish and prefigure the globa l diversity of the anglophone wor ld. Along the way, 
you will develop familiarity with  old English and multiple dial ects of middle English. You will b egin to chart the continuitie s and ruptures involved 
in the transitions from tribal h eroic culture to a growing sens e of common identity as Englis h people of an English kingdom. A nd on a parallel 
trajectory, you will track how the notion of a specifically Eng lish literature written by the E nglish, in Englis h, for the Eng lish, emerges from 
adaptations and negotiations with o ther European vernaculars. T his focus forms a bridge to fu rther study in early modern or Re naissance English 
literature. The tools of philology, historical language study, rhetorical analysis, and manuscr ipt studies, lend themselves to  this course's emphasis on 
language and history, and in developing facility with them, you  will be better prepared for the study of any area of literatur e.

Minimum Credits:  3

The Himalayan region is charact erized by a tremendous range of social and cultural diversity t hat corresponds to climatic, eco logical and 
geographical variation, as well a s local and regional geopoliti cal factors. Historical change from the emergence of early form s of social complexity 
centered on chiefs and their fort s ' from which the regional de signation of 'Garhwali' takes its name ' through the developmen t of kingdoms and larger 
polities shows the intimate link between geography, environment  and socio-political transforma tion. Similarly, local language patterns, regional 
religious practices, musical sty les, mythology, food culture, s artorial fashion, architectural design, agricultural and transp ortation technologies and 
engineering and trade networks h ave all been shaped by the stru cture of Muntain barriers, bounded valley communities and brack eted lines of 
communication that follow river systems. Whereas the political economy of the Himalay as has been structured around agricultura l production, and 
the development of elaborate field terrace systems, there have also been subsidiary economies centered on trans-Himalayan trad e and pilgrimage as 
well as pastoral nomadism and transhumance. Since the colonial period, the Himalayas have increasingly become a place for rest , relaxation, tourism 
and adventure, and this ' along w ith further political transfor mations since Indian independence `has led to the rapid develop ment of urban areas. This 
course will provide a survey of Himalayan history, society and culture with a focus on the rela tionship among nature, the envi ronment and

with one another, and how these p atterns and structures of comm unication define different kinds  of interdependence. Within the  framework of

FMST 0760 - CRITICAL MAKING 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The Maker movement is an emerging social and media form that is  at once highly networked and pos t-digital. Making is situated at the intersection 
of social media, the online gift  economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with  one's physical environment. Dra wing on open source 
ideals and innovation structures - the free sharing of code to e nable collaborative development - making has become an attempt to democratize 
material culture through networke d access to tools. MakerSpaces  and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materia lize the virtual gift 
economy of the Internet. In this  course we will en gage the inte llectual and practical roots of t his new medial and social form  and engage in our own 
critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will b egin by looking at the history and philosophy of open 
source software development, and then the political, social, cu ltural, and technological develop ments that have together given  rise to critical maker 
culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning , modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printin g assignments, students 
will form groups and develop coll aborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a t opic of your choice and 
in a medium of your choi ce. The aim of this course is to "close  the circuit" between creative conceptual production, social ne tworking, and 
materialized object r elationships. Critica l making is about cri tically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. B y the end of the 
semester, you will become a critical maker! This is a Critical Studies course with Production el ements and counts for Category  III towards the Film 
and Media Studies  major and minor.

FMST 0762 - MEDIA/ECOLOGY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
From the late twentieth century t o the present, ecology as a sc ientific discipline and set of cultural narratives has risen to  the forefront of knowledge 
production as a way to study and understand complex biological systems, their environments, and their internal dynamics. Durin g the same period, 
media systems have grown expone ntially in complexity until they  too have begun to exhibit some o f the behaviors of ecological systems, including 
self-organization, feedback, evolution, and emergent properties . The term "media ecology" captu res both this new, nonlinear sy stems approach to 
understanding media its elf as well as the i ntersection between natural ecosystems and the tec hnological assemblages with which  they are intertwined. 
This course will explore both me dia that interface with natural  ecosystems and works that engage contemporary media systems at  different scales. 
The secret life of information,  contagious media, and the post- natural ecologies of our present  and future will challenge us t o conceive of Media and 
Ecology as a single coupled syste m: the emblem of our contempor ary environment. Students will  have the option to produce colla borative media 1322 
 projects that explore the themes of the course. These can take the form of simulations, games, network graphing, film or video  projects, local 
ecosystem analysis and/or visua lization, or the mapping and ana lysis of a media ecosystem that interfaces with the environment . This is a Critical

FMST 1321 - EASTERN EUROPEAN  COMMUNISM AT THE MOVIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
After the 1917 revolution in Russi a, Lenin famously said: "to u s film is the most important of al l the arts." Communists were to use cinema for 
propaganda purposes, in order to carry out massive state-wide c ampaigns aiming to bring radical s ocial change. However, Soviet  avant-garde 
filmmakers were also concerned with revolutionizing filmmaking itself. Some three decades after Lenin's remarks, the leaders o f the countries of 
Eastern Europe which had become "Soviet satellites" after World  War II, attempted to use censorship and control over the arts and cinema to produce 
effective propaganda for their own political campaigns. Writers , artists, and filmmakers were coveted allies of these new comm unist regimes that 
came to power in the 1940s. Again, however, f ilmmakers and acto rs did not always toe the Party line. Some were able to use fil m to craft complex 
works with subtle messages portray ing aspects of daily life as it was experienced by ordinary p eople under the new regimes. Fi lms that we will watch 
and analyze, released in Hungary , Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia in the decades  before the fall of communism in 1989 managed 
to depict, evoke, and criticize "really existing communism." Th is course will trace the history of East European communism and  of East European 
film-making from 1944 to 1990, ac quainting students with exampl es from an exceptional body of cin ematographic work together wi th the broad 
outlines of East European history . Students will learn to "read " films from 20th century Eastern Europe in their cultural, pol itical, and historical

FMST 1346 - DRUGS, MONEY AND VIO LENCE: NARCO-CULTU RE IN LATIN A MERICAN FILM 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course explores the complex, multi-layered, and often cont radictory world of tra nsnational narcotics traffic particularly  as it is configured in and 
through contemporary Latin Ameri can cinema. Departing from the contention that the rel ations between drug trafficking networks , governmental 
responses to the drug trade, dr ug production and consumption, a re not clear and transparent as depicted in dominant discourses  exemplified by the 
narrative of the War on Drugs, th is course analyzes narco-cultu re not as a simplis tic response centered merely on the idolizat ion of drug lords or drug 
culture, but as a dynamic creative current that tries to make s ense of the complexity and violen ce of the world of drugs. Why do official narratives of 
capitalist enterprise disavow the  capitalist foundation of the drug trade? How are discourses of security and protection ironi cally embodied in violent 
militarized actions and neo-imperial ventures? How does the cri minalization of certain cultural practices and symbols - partic ular languages, dress 
codes, music - relate to the racialization and sexualization of  certain peoples and bodies? Moreover, how can we understand th e (global) commercial 
success of narco-culture as exemplified by recent mainstream me dia and popular culture? In this course, we will address these questions by engaging 
in close reading/viewing of conte mporary Latin American films t hat center on representations a nd (re)productions of narco-cult ure. These primary 
works will be examined in conjun ction with secondary readings t hat discuss topics relevant to o ur analysis of narco-culture, s uch as globalization, 
neoliberal capitalism, immigra tion, femicides, cultural appropr iation, and racial and gender construction.

FMST 1411 - FILM AND LITERATURE 
Minimum Credits:  3

Cinema has enjoyed a close relat ionship with lit erature, borrow ing from literary source texts and forms. Yet this relationship  is not uncomplicated, 
nor is it unidirectional: the cinema offers new possibilities f or novelistic source texts, pos es interesting problems for lite rature's authors and readers 
alike and provokes a reconsiderat ion of age-old debates of the divide between words and images. Thus this course  examines film 's convergence with, 
and divergence from, literary forms. Poised at the intersection  of the study of film and the study of literature, it enables u s to explore what is most 
unique -- and perhaps most inter esting -- about each of the med ia as we consider their overlap. This is a Critical Studies cou rse and counts for

FR 0090 - EURO CHIC: THE  INVENTION OF FASHION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Since the Renaissance, Italy a nd France have occupied a fundame ntal role in the estab lishment and development of fashion as a creative and 
commercial enterprise deeply rooted in cultural mores. The cour se address the historical shifts in the cultural understanding of gender roles, class 
belonging, consumption habits a nd expectations, the internation al circulation of craftmanship and celebrities, and technologic al innovation. We will 
start addressing the anthropology  of body ornamentation, gender  markings and the difference bet ween costume and fashion. Our h istorical point of 
departure is the grand arrival of  Catherine De Medici from Flor ence to Paris in 1547, following her marriage to King Henry II of France. We then 
follow the progressive establishment of Paris as the capital of  European (and eventually inter national) fashion,  together with  Italian cities like 
Florence, Venice and Milan. We also take a significant detour t hrough London during the "dandy" era  of the early 19th century and the "mod" and 
"punk" trends of the decades bet ween 1960 and 1980. Punk leads us into a discussion of current i nternational "anti-fashion" tr ends, such as the 1359 
 politics and economics of privilege, cheap labor and environmen tal concerns about "fast fashion."  This course is taught in Eng lish. *This course may 
be used for the Italian Studies  major (whether listed as FR 009 0 or ITAL 0090), but does not coun t for the Italian major or th e Italian minor.

speaking spaces that go well bey ond the borders of modern Franc e. We explore the global use of the French language as a cognit ive and

structures), all wh ile engaging in spontaneous conversation or written communication on familiar topics using dialect-appropri ate vocabulary and 
grammar. Though class discussions and the st udy of primary visu al, written and sung texts, we w ill consider quest ions such as:  How precisely is 
French "global"? How is the Fren ch spoken in one part of the wo rld different from th at spoken in other par ts of the world? How  do different Frenches 
reflect different cultural values? How does migration function between Francophone cultures? Pre requisite: FR 0103, placement,  or equivalent.

 FR 1023 - FRENCH THE ATRICAL WORKSHOP 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
In "French Theatre Wor kshop," the class beha ves as a performing  troupe, with every student bei ng involved in eve ry stage of a theatre production. 
Students refine their communication skills by memorizing lines,  delivering them, and interac ting in a foreign language. They c raft characters with the 
goal of conveying their own readi ng of L'Ecole des femmes in an  artistic performance. In the fi rst sessions, students analyze a classical French play 
written by Moliare, familiarizing themselves with the history o f theatre and the types of characters displayed in European tra ditions. In L'Ecole des 
femmes, the playwright makes fun of Arnolphe, an insecure old m an so afraid of being cheated on  by his wife tha t he prefers to  educate a girl from 
the countryside and mold her thr ough his principles in order to  marry her. In their staging of the play, students transform th e early modern text into 
contemporary French and make it resonate in our post #MeToo era , giving their own interpretatio n of what is considered "tradit ional,""modest," or 
"daring" today. To that end, stu dents are introduced to differe nt acting techniques, from repea ting alexandrins, movement work  with Commedia 
Dell'Arte masks, and improvising i n French around situations de picted in the play. Later in the semester, students either work  on their acting, or help 
design the set, build the props, arrange the costumes, produce the flyers, and contribute to the  overall staging of the perfor mance that will be open to 
the general public, including al l French majors and minors. The  class weaves acting and digital creation, as the performance w ill also include short 
videos projected on th e set. All students ar e expected to refle ct on their experience and experiments with French Theatre by w riting in a logbook 
throughout the semester, to partic ipate in a collective brainst orm on the class forum, and to  design a moodboard on Tumblr.

FR 1025 - THE IDEA OF FRANCE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
In this course, stude nts will examine the question of how Franc e, the French nation , and Frenchness (francité) have been imagi ned. What is the "idea 
of France" throughout different historical periods? How do mode rn notions of what France is ima gined to be relate to pre-moder n notions? What 
have different time periods (such  as the Middle Ages, the Renai ssance, the Enlightenment, colonization) contributed to the con cept of France? What 
role does language play in Frenc hness? How do con cepts of race,  gender, and ethnicity factor in to all these questions? This c ourse will investigate 
what France was/is thought to be , how it is constructed through  words, images, and acts. To treat this topic, we will take an interdisciplinary cultural 
studies approach. This means we will examine many types of "tex ts", including literature, philos ophy, manifestos, historical d ocuments, film, video, 
music, webpages, architecture, newspaper and magazine articles,  essays, works of art, maps, encyc lopedias, and di ctionaries. W e will investigate the 
concept of "citizenship" in challenging texts and relate it to current events and the news. Thi s course is also about you shar ing your knowledge and 
passion for things French with t he general public, through rese arch in the French Nationality Room archives and the organizati on of an event during 
the Week of Francophoni e. You will also write  formally and info rmally in French in several genres (academic paper, op-ed piece , rationale, podcast 
script). This course will be taught in French.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 1367 
 This course is taught i n English. Some of the most important th inkers about gender and sexuality  are French. In this course, y ou will study French 
philosophical thought about both ge nder and sexuality. We will discuss and evaluate the theoret ical claims made by key French thinkers, including 
ethical relations between men and women that they posit or crit ique. Questions of language, disc ourse, and representation are central to this tradition, 
and we will evaluate to what exte nt this focus affects (positiv ely or negatively) gender and sexual politics. How can language  be political? To what 
extent can it promote gender equality? Questions of gender esse ntialism and the "nature" of men and women will a lso be central  to the course. 
Gender and sexuality will be taken in the broad sense, and we w ill consider thought on women, equ ality, and feminism as well a s queerness, 
homosexuality, intersex , masculinity, trans*, and race/gender i ntersections. We will also consid er the transatlantic reception  of French thought in 
American gender theory. This interdisciplinary course is open t o all students. As the French have been deeply influential in g ender theory, this course 
will help students understand a k ey Western intellectual tradit ion. This course is taught in E nglish, and all readings will be  in English. No knowledge

FR 1070 - GENDER AND SEXUALIT Y IN 21ST CENTURY FRANCE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
French culture has always had mu ch to say about questions of ge nder and sexuality. In this course , we will consider key cultur al products, 
perspectives, and practices around the concept of gender broadl y conceived, including masculin ity, feminism, het ero/homosexual ity, transgenre, and 
others. Questions of nation, rac e, and ethnicity will factor in to our discussions as well, and we will think often about the w ords or language that texts 
employ to talk about gender. We will also engage in cross-cultu ral comparison between France and our own cultural context(s) t o give us 
comparative insight into the world we live in. We will treat qu estions such as: What is the current 'crisis' in French masculi nity? What does it mean to 
be a man today in France? What is the current state of feminism  in France, and how does it dif fer from previous incarnations? How does the 
discourse of homosexuality and queerness compare to the US cont ext? What does transgenre signify? When and how did transgenre appear as a 
category in France? How  are French constructs of gender inflect ed with Arab or North African identities? What other recurring forms of 
intersectionality are there? And how is all this represented in  cultural texts? Our focus will be French culture since the tur n of the century. Taking an 
interdisciplinary cultural studies approach, this is not a lite rature course per se (though we w ill read some lit erature). To aid us in our t ask, we will 
discuss and analyze a wide variety of recent texts in French fr om the 21st century: comic books (BD), films , documentaries, Yo uTube videos, music, 
webpages, journalistic prose, man ifestos, political and governm ent tracts, school textbooks, autof iction, novels, children's l iterature, pop psychology, 
etc. As the course i s taught entirely in French and all written  work is in French, you will inc rease your linguistic proficien cy in reading, writing, 
speaking, and listening. You will also acquire the semantic too ls you need to talk and write abou t gender and sexuality in Fre nch. Prerequisite: at 
least six credits above French 10 4, or permission of the instru ctor.

From environmental issues to ge nder politics, from the culture of capitalism to universal human rights, from media encroachmen t to esthetic values,

Thomas Piketty, and then goes through a chronological review of  the significance of enlightenme nt thinkers such as Voltaire an d Rousseau, early

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Climate change is forcing us to radically rethink the human pos ition in our environment. In th is class (taught in English with  all reading in 
translation), students will benefit from the important contribu tions that French-speaking thinke rs have made to our conceptual  arsenal in the field of 
environmental et hics and philosophy. Some of our questions will  include: Why are we still read ing and debating Jean-Jacques Ro usseau's evocation 
of a state of nature and his cri tique of Western social and pol itical development? W hy did French philosophers and cultural sc holars recast Martin 
Heidegger's understanding of th e Umwelt (the World Around Us) a nd his critique of technology? How did Rousseau and Denis Dider ot critique the 
French colonial enterprise already in the 18th century? How do post- and decolonial thinkers ref rame the debate about the Anth ropocene today? And 
finally, how do philosophy and ethi cs offer us the tools to tak e a stand in today's political deb ates about the future of the human environment? In 
short, how can we "think the Ear th"? Open to any student (no pr erequisite), the course may be o f particular interest to studen ts in areas such as the 
humanities, the natural sciences, history, environmental studie s, political philosophy, global/in ternational studies, public h ealth, and the sustainability

GSWS 0200 - SEX, RACE, AND POPULAR CULTURE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Popular culture is often defined as a collection of ideas, imag es, beliefs and practices that ha ve become an essential compone nt of peoples' daily lives. 
While popular culture i s dismissed by some as merely a mass con sumer culture, others acknowle dge that contemporary popular cul tural forms may, 
in keeping with a history of on ce contemporary popular art, cul ture, and literature (e.g. Dickens, Warhol, etc.) Come to be un derstood as essential, 
canonical and elite. U ltimately, these mate rials may be read as  a texts that inform our understa nding of culture and social li fe and prompt such 
questions as: how does popular cu lture (re)construct our sense of "ordinary" life as something extraordinary? Why are some cul tural forms dismissed 
and others more readily accepted ? What social processes bring c ultural forms into the public domain? This course will examine popular culture in a 
variety of forms such as: music,  art, television, collectibles,  internet, and social media. St udents will consider examples fr om Western, non-Western, 
and "global" culture, but will use sex and sexuality, gender, a nd ideas of race to understand the relationship between popular  culture, material culture, 
representation, and cons umerism, and power a nd resistance. It w ill also address these phenomenon  over time. This course will m ake especially strong 
use of contemporary and popular m edia such as video clips, inte rnet media and images, and music.

This course focuses on the intera ction of gender and sexuality with science, medicin e, and technology. The goal of this course  is to assist students in 
developing an understanding of th e ways in which science has co nstructed our understanding of gender and sexuality since the n ineteenth century, as 
well as the lived experiences of people within the scientific c ommunity who shape and navigate these concepts. To accomplish t his goal, we will 
apply feminist theory, including feminist critiques of the hist ory of medicine, psychology, and science, and gender theory, to  an investigation of the 
evolution of scientific knowledg e regarding gende r and sexualit y, as well as race, disability, and health. We will also explor e the ways in which 
people, especially wom en, people of color, and transpeople have  interacted with technology, shape d scientific discourse. In ea ch course lecture and 
discussion, we will focus on a broad range of scientific fields , discourses, and narratives to  construct a comprehensive under standing of the scientific 
knowledge and identity in the mode rn world. While the readings focus largely on American and Western examples and experiences,  class discussions 
and presentations will expand the  scope of this class considera bly, allowing students to unders tand the global relationship of  gender and science.

This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the feminis t ideas and debates concerning g ender, women and men, and their  political, social and

perspectives on gender, race, c lass, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of femi nist theory, this course will a pproach 'theory' as attempts 
to answer fundamental questions  about the power relations that structure our everyda y lives and conscious ness. Theory in this sense is a tool for 
thinking systematica lly about how the world works, and for cons tructing arguments about  how it should work. Consequently, we w ill pay particular 
attention to the (de)constructio n of power in both public and p rivate relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and pr esent ideas in class, and 
complete written analyses. Stude nts will have opportunities to apply feminist theories to their work in their home disciplines .

GSWS 1130 - GENDERED BODIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
For centuries, the biological sciences have embraced the human body as a product of nature in n eed of study, measurement, and treatment. Much of 
this knowledge has contributed t o discourses of "normal" and "h ealthy" bodies. However, contemporary social science and femini st perspectives 
offer alternative readings of the human body as a social constr uction based upon cultural conven tions and perceptions of gende r, race, class, and 
sexuality. As Lorber and others have argued, "the result is a g endered body, produced for a gende red social world." This class  will examine a wide 
variety of gendered social cons tructions of the human body at w ork, in sports, and in media images that reflect standards and ideals of "beauty," 
"health" and "deviance." We will also consider the meaning of g endered bodies in light of contem porary technologies - such as plastic surgery, 
steroids, infertility treatments - that help to reveal the ways  in which males, femal es, and "others" beco me "men" and "women. "

Food is sustenance a nd absolutely essentia l to life. But food i s never simply about nutrition. B ecause it is fundamental to th e human experience, food 
is also a medium for the expressi on of culture and social ident ity. Moreover, food relays complex  social messages about gender , sexuality, and 
family. Consequently, food is also a means for expressing the s ocial and symbolic use of power a nd control in which social ine qualities are expressed 
in culinary forms. This course w ill examine food from the vanta ge point of gendered systems of production, distribution, and c onsumption as we 
consider: How does your food com e to your table (or not) and wh at are the political implications of personal tastes? By the en d of this course, 
students will be able to: 1) a pply anthropologica l and feminist  theories to food and eating in a  cross-cultural perspective; 2 ) understand how gender, 
race and class influence our a ccess to and perspective on food;  and 3) make connections between  eating and cultural identities  and beliefs.

This course develops students' u nderstanding of diversity and g lobal issues in relation to sexuality and sexual identities in a transnational context. 
More than just assuming that sexuality and sexual identities ar e stable across different histor ic periods and geo-political co ntexts, this course 
approaches sexuality and sexual politics from the perspective t hat there are diverse ways that people express their sexuality across time and place, 
and that these expressions are e mbedded in polit ics of contesta tion, resistance, and liberation connected to histories of colo nialism and contemporary 
conditions of globalization. Look ing at social movements, globa l conflicts, violence, activism,  and socio-legal frameworks, th e course investigates 
how sexuality, sexual identities , and sexual poli tics are much more diverse across the globe t han popularly understood. Lookin g specifically at the 
relationship between sexuality and colonialism, race and racial ization, gender identity, ethnicity, globalization, neoliberali sm, and citizenship, the 
course introduces students to t exts that interrogate the assump tion that sexuality is stable, c oherent, or universal; instead,  these texts argue that 
sexuality is diverse across histor y and geography, and a key fa cet of both human self-expr ession and global politics.

Tourism is among one of the worl d's largest industries, generat ing trillions of dollars in re venues and employing millions. It  is heavily relied upon as 
an economic strategy for developi ng countries. This course will  examine the gendered cultural practices of travel and the impa ct tourism has on both 
host and guest communi ties. Leisure activities were once deemed  unimportant topics for study. How ever, tourism has been a cent ral dimension of 
globalization, and it can be use d as a lens to reflect on many questions about identity and her itage, commoditization, histori cal and cultural 
representation, authenticity and  ownership, neoliberalism, ineq uality, gender relations, environmental sustainability, and mor e. We will examine 
various forms of tourism, includi ng, but not limit ed to: ethnic , historical, regional, and ecot ourism. We will pay close atten tion to health and medical 
tourism, a growing phe nomenon in today's gl obal world. Themes o f the gaze, authenticity, identity, consumption, ritual, border s, and pilgrimage will 
be considered throughout the term es pecially with regard to the  ways in which they simultaneously draw upon and reconstruct no tions of the "Other" 
that are built upon social constr uctions of gende r, race, class , sexuality, age, ability, etc. There are no prerequisites for this course, although GSWS

Although childhood is often confla ted with a biological categor y based on an immature body, in re ality it is much more. Instea d, this course examines 
the ways in which ch ildhood is a discursive and continuously sh ifting category, one that changes across time and place. This c ourse will introduce 
students to the study of child ren and childhood in a cross-cult ural context and will pay particular attention to the ways in w hich notions of childhood, 
and the experience of being a ch ild, draw from and reproduce un derstandings of gender and sexual ity as they intersect with rac e, class, ethnicity, etc. 
Through readings, lectures, and fi lms, we will also consider th e meaning of gendered childhoods i n light of contemporary forms  of conception, 
children's culture (media, toys and artifacts, stories), child labor and play, and ritual and coming of age ceremonies. An ana lysis of these 
contemporary phenomenon highlight  local and regional notions of  childhood and their intersection with broader global patterns.  In addition to 
lectures, a portion of each cla ss will be devoted to group disc ussions in which students are e ncourage to engage with the cour se readings. Students 
will give presentations and assist with discussion facilitation . We will also view films. Evalu ations will be based on the stu dent's participation in 
these discussions, as well as two exams, and a series of four w riting assignments.

GSWS 1470 - GENDER & CIT IZENSHIP IN EUROPE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This Study Abroad course analyse s womenâs claims  for citizenshi p throughout twentieth and early t wenty-first century Europe fr om a variety of 
perspectives. By 1945,  the majority of women in Europe had been  enfranchised, yet as women dema nded to exercise the rights of citizenship, they 
frequently faced limitations upon th eir rights as citizens base d on gender. This course charts the ways in which women have ad apted to and attempted 
to challenge the ide ological, political an d material conditions  of citizenship in modern Europe.  Topics to be examined include : women's political 
activism; citizenship and warfare; consumer citizenship; sexual ity and reproductive rights; and citizenship within the context  of multicultural society. 
Classes are arranged both chronologically and thematically, and  will combine contextual lectures, seminars, and presentations in order to facilitate 
discussion. The course is organi zed around three key themes: Wo men, Regulation and th e State; Gender Discourses; and Citizensh ip and Womenâs 
Activism. Each of these themes is designed to allow students to  engage with a wide array of hist orical and contemporary source s including: personal 
narratives, political essays, rep resentations of women in art, fiction, and the contemporary me dia, and a variety of field stu dies based in London.

GSWS 1610 - QUEER AND FEMINIST MEDIA ART 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course develops students' u nderstanding of diversity and w ill build that understanding thr ough the production of creative  work relating to media 
art that is focused on gender  and sexuality. Looking at the dif ferent ways that people express their gender and sexuality usin g media - including but 
not limited to: video and film, digital media, images, analog m edia, etc. - this course surveys the diverse ways that people e xpress their sexuality and 
gender through creative expression s that are also connected to social change, resista nce, and difference. Surveying a wide ran ge of queer and feminist 
media, the course asks students to examine the relationship bet ween gender, sexuality and colonialism, race and racialization,  ethnicity, globalization, 
religion, and nationalism through th e formats of creative expre ssion. The course draws heavily on  building creative assignment s on topics relating to 
gender and sexuality, including self-reflexive projects that as k students to think about their own relationship to these categ ories through creative 
mediums. Class assignments are d esigned to connect analytic too ls from readings and class analysis of media objects to the cre ative process of 
making media art works. Students will also create art works in the class, such as making their own animated GIF, a performance  video, and a final 
media project, all paired with reflexive writing assignments.

GEOL 1330 - SUSTAINA BILITY FLASH LAB 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Sustainability involves a system s approach. By exploring the in puts and outputs of energy and re sources, we will ask broad que stions: How do we 1390 
 measure production and consumpti on? How do geogr aphical and soc io-economic environmen ts affect these things? How do we go beyo nd traditional 
measurements to quantify more com prehensive impacts and life-cy cles? Answering these larger questions begins on a smaller, ver y specific, and 
personal scale: Where  you live, and how you live. By examining and measuring resource use (inc luding electricity, water and se wage, garbage and 
recycling, energy us e, and transportation) , we trace inputs and  outputs to their source/destina tion, and begin to unravel and understand the complex 
web of production, distribution,  delivery, and environmental co nsequences. We will investigate how these metrics change due to  location and societal 
practices, as well as changes cr eated through conservation and public policy. Eventua lly, it is the aim of this course to also  reflect, at cultural and 
philosophical levels, on our ener gy/resource usage and underlyi ng causalities thereof.

Environmental Advocacy is much m ore than simply advocating. To be effective, you must  also take Action,  and although "enthusia sm" goes a long 
way, volunteers and pr ofessionals alike need a wide range of sk ills in order to make a lasting impact. This includes planning successful events, 
running effective meet ings, communicating science, writing gran ts, accounting & mind-numbing IRS  paperwork, avoiding burn-out,  and dealing 
with the media, volunteers, gover nment and people who don't agr ee with you. It can be overwhel ming even to those who know what  to expect! And 
don't forget about the actual goa l: Making a diffe rence. This c ourse covers the "inner workings" of environmental advocacy. We  go beyond the 
slogans, logos, direct m ail, and big events to study what's beh ind the nonprofit world, what it t akes to succeed at the grassr oots. Speakers from the 
Pittsburgh environmental community  will share their experiences , concerns, and persp ectives most weeks, and a wide range of re adings and

controversial restrictions on national forest timbering in the pacific northwest, there is tre mendous pressure to cut the loca l hardwood forests. But 
unlike the turn of the century when all of Penn' s woods was cle ar-cut, there is a growing ethic that believes trees are more v aluable growing than cut - 
for recreation and environmental reasons. This course on forest  and parks issues is the fourth in a series that focuses on env ironmental and public

impulse. Who was this person, Karl Marx? Why is it that in this  post-cold war world his writings  continue both to inspire and threaten contemporary 
readers? How have those inspired  by Marx further developed his ideas to constitute the discourse  of Marxism? These are some of  the questions that 
this course will raise and try to  answer. We will begin with di scussions of key work s by Marx. Concentrating on the question o f culture and cultural 
analysis, we will then move on t o examine some significant cont ributions to Marxism. The cour se will end by looking at contemp orary attempts at 
rethinking Marxism. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

HHD 1542 - EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVE NTIONS IN REAL WORLD CONTEXTS I 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Evidence-based interventions (EBIS) are the foundation of effec tive and high-quality prevention and intervention programs in e ducation, human 
services, and healthcare. Both p re-service and continuing educa tion of interdisciplinary profe ssionals must em phasize the acqu isition of knowledge 
and applied competencies about d iverse ebis in this continuousl y evolving area. Many forms of p revention and intervention are used in education, 
human services, and healthcare, but few such practices have 'pr actice-based evidence' conducted in real-world s ettings which v alidate their continued 
use. Thus, in this course, stude nts will gain knowledge and ski lls in evidence-based contextual  and individual interventions, their content, 
methodology, implementation, and evaluation. The course will he lp students who are interventionists but is not primarily clini cal in orientation. 
Rather, it is designed to prepare future leaders ' practitioner s, researchers, program  administrators/directors, program evalu ators, and policy 
specialists - in best practi ces and their implications

HINDI 1615 - MANY RAMAYANAS: TRADIT ION AND DIVERSITY IN MODERN INDIA 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course will intr oduce you to the great Hindu epic, the Ram ayana, a blue-print for daily living in India. Although compose d two millennia ago, 
the remarkable fluidity of the story has resulted in literally hundreds of Ramayanas, as it conti nues to be retold and reimagi ned while moving across 
space and time. Within the Ramayana itself there are many contr oversial episodes; among these t he two most important are Sita' s trial-by-fire and her 
subsequent banishment by her husb and, Rama, and Rama's mutilati on of Shurpanakha as punishment fo r the latter's bold romantic and sexual 
overtures. These incidents are of  great import because the fait hful and loyal Sita is the "Ideal  Indian woman" in popular imag ination even today. 
More significant is the fact that authors and commentators cont inue to use both these character s to address modern issues rela ting to gender 
inequality. The Ramayana is thus a rich source of information n ot just in literary terms, alt hough its defining characteristic , its fluidity, is under 
threat, with groups on the ultraright attempting to dictate the  "correct" version , but also in political, social and religiou s terms. This course will thus 
take a multi-disciplinary role i n exploring the richness of wha t modern scholars have come to c all the Ramayana tradition, and  its role in I ndia today; 
we will study its implications for  women, its reception in Sout h India, and its role in the rising tide of Indian nationalism,  while eventually 
questioning whether its characteristic fluidity is at threat by  those who insist on on ly one "pure" version.

How are these often overlooked details connected to larger soci al phenomena and structures? How can the literary representatio n of individual food 
choice provide clues to the ra cial and migratory politics of la te nineteenth-century Brazil? T hrough a critical  examination of  literary texts, art, 
performances, and films from Br azil, Angola, Mozambique, and Gu inea Bissau that center on the senses and the sensorial, this c ourse explores the 
woven logics of sensorial repr esentation and cultural narrative s of race, gender, class, polit ics, and nation in the Lusophone  world. Aided by 
accompanying theoretical readings as well as individual researc h, students are expected to criti cally discuss bot h in the clas sroom with their peers and 
through formal writing assignments  the connections between sens orial representations and cultural narratives related to nation  building, 
(neo)coloniality, post-revolutionary disillusionment, historica l reverberations in the contem porary present, a mong others, wit hin the Lusosphere. Key

among other issues within a contem porary context. Students are expected to engage in critical discussions with the materials a nd the varying

mind that rather than attempting an exhaustive survey of the Po rtuguese-speaking world in its e ntirety, the course provides me rely a glimpse into the 
cultural offerings of these diver se and vast geographical regio ns; it is also an attempt to prom ote global and cultural unders tanding. Hopefully,

HIST 0200 - BETWEEN KAFKA AND HIT LER: HOW CENTRAL EUROPE SHAPED  THE MODERN 
WORLD 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course offers an introduction to the his torical experience  of Central Europe, the most di verse and dynamic region of mode rn Europe. Close to 
twenty nations with together mo re than 200 million people exist  today between the rivers Rhine and Dnepr, between the Baltic a nd the Aegean Seas, 
from Germany in the west to Est onia in the northeast and Greece  in south. Since the 1800s, this  region made its mark on the wo rld through an 
astounding cultural and intellectual creativity. People like He gel and Marx, Kafka and Freud, A lbert Einstein and Marie Curie changed the way we 
think. Yet 20th-century Central Europe was also a place of unpr ecedented mass violence and destruction, the main theater of tw o world wars and the 
site of the Holocaust. During th e Cold War, it became the focal  point of a global ideological conflict that divided the world into east and west. Ever 
since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Central Europe is the place  where these divided worlds are growing together  again. The stu dy of this region and the 
socioeconomic and cultural forces  that shaped it provides a fas cinating lens for a better unders tanding of the modern world. T his includes the fact that 
many of those who built  Pittsburgh came from Central Europe and  left their mark in this city. T he course serves as core course  for the Central

Words have consequences. How a so ciety defines "religion" and " culture" have much to say about how they balance individual fre edom and

help us learn how religion influe nces the lives o f individuals and the wider societies in which they live. Themes dealt with i nclude the relationship 
between religion and politics and law; nationalism, terrorism, and secularization; gender, sexuality, and the family; healing,  the environment, and 
ethical behavior; and the life cycle and ritual calendar year. By looking at how these  issues unfold in modern China and Japan  and at their global 
significance enable us to bette r understand how religion shapes  our world.

HIST 0752 - EMPIRES OF THE STEPPE : EURASIA FROM THE MONGOLS TO THE SOVIET UNION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Over the last several centuries, EurAsia's  domination by succes sive nomadic steppe empires (str etching from Europe to China) w as displaced by new 
imperial challengers from the pe riphery (notably Russia, China,  and Britain). This c ourse examines the nature of that transiti on by charting the 
history of EurAsian empires fro m the Mongols (thirteenth centur y) to the present day. From Geng his Khan to Tamerlane to Stalin ; between Russian 
spies, Chinese armies, and the Taliban; spanning silk roads, gr eat games, and more. The empires of the steppe were truly vast in scale, integrating 
territories usually studied in is olation from one another, and so this course provides importa nt context for se parate courses on Russian, eastern 
European, Chinese, and middle ea stern history. The chronologica l scope of this course is simila rly epic, spanning over seven c enturies, and thus 
placing in relief recurring themes related to empires in world history. The thematic emphasis i s on geopolitical strategies fo r imperial rule, but the 
course will also examine culture, religion, and political econo my.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course seeks to impart an u nderstanding of the Islamic tra dition by exploring the religion' s formative period. It integra tes two intertwined 
themes: (1) early Islamic empires as geopolitical formations; a nd (2) the development of ideas , from ritual to philosophy to l aw. The first centuries of 
Islam are fascinating for many of  the same reasons they are com plex and even controversial: Sur viving primary sources are frag mented, partisan, and 
often retrospective; a tremendou s range of voices competed to d efine the new religion; and nearly all subsequent Muslim thinke rs would harken back 
to this period to legitimize the ir own positions. The central g oal is to develop an understandi ng of the diversity of voices i n this early period and 
consider why certain conceptualizations of religion displaced o thers; and then follow those voi ces beyond the Arabian Peninsul a to examine 
manifestations in the North A frican and Central Asian borderlan ds.

Minimum Credits:  3

Why are some places so rich and o thers so poor? Do climate-base d, geographic, or other natural factors account for the deep di sparities between 
world regions? Or do these reflec t human choices and hierarchie s of power, within countries or between them? In this course we  debate the causes of 
global inequality and ask what can be done about it. Are intern ational efforts to sha pe economic growth in the world's poorest  countries triumphing 
over poverty or making the proble m much worse? Is 'internationa l development' a success stor y, a failure, or a fraud?

HIST 1048 - THE HOLOCAUST IN CONTEXT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
"Ethnic cleansing" and "genocide" are neither twentieth-century  phenomena, nor is their occurre nce linked to any particular re gion in the world. 
However, during the two world wars and their aftermath acts the  civilian population of Central and Eastern Europe experienced a degree of mass 
violence that not only changed to  face of the region but also l ed to the establishmen t of the very term "genocide". The Holoca ust stands out as the 
most comprehensive, most radically executed case of genocide in  modern times. Yet it was embedded  in a wider context of system atic violence 
against various populations in Ce ntral and Eastern Europe. Rath er than beginning with a general, abstract reflection on the re asons for the various 
forms of mass violence  from ethnic cleansing to genocide, this course allows students to explore the specif ic social, cultural , and political conditions 
under which the sometimes entangl ed cases of mass violence agai nst civilians occurred in twentieth-century Central and Eastern  Europe. The course 
concludes with a general reflec tion and discussion of the conce pt of "genocide", the limits of its analytical usefulness, and the political baggage it 
carries.

Europe experienced unprecedented levels of destruction and viol ence during the Second World War.  The experience of ethnic clea nsing and mass 
murder, with the Holocaust stand ing out as the most disturbing case of mass murder in modern times, were so traumatic that man y people lost their 
faith in modern civilization as s uch. Against this backdrop, wo uld have predicted that Europe  would not only r ecover but also reach an unprecedented 
level of political stability, prosperity, and civility after th e Second World War. This course examines the striking transform ation of postwar Europe 
by exploring the strategies Eur opean societies - with significa nt involvement of the United Stat es - pursued to overcome the t raumas of war and 
rebuild a shattered continent. Cou rse topics include the legal persecution of war crimes, the bui lding of societies and politi cal orders that are based on 
the respect of human rights and the rule of law, the reconstruc tion of Europe's bombe d cities, and the a ttempts to overcome na tionalism and xeno-
phobia through various forms of European integration.

In 1898 Spain lost its empire dur ing the Spanish-American War. Portugal, instead, preserved its empire for most of the 20th ce ntury. This divergence 
resulted in different developments such as a Civil War in Spain  (1936-1939) and a political revolution in Portugal (1974). How ever, both countries 
also shared similar experiences : long-lasting authoritarian reg imes, democratic transitions, and incorporation into the Europe an community. The

HIST 1157 - HISTORY OF MAPS AND SPATIAL REPRESENTATION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
It has been famously been observed that "the map is not the ter ritory." Any useful map must omit a great deal of information a bout the territory it 
represents, and must generalize information about the real worl d into a small number of highly schematized categories. All map s are based on 
particular technological affordances, executed within a certain  cultural, political and histori cal context. Humans think visua lly about space, and 
almost every society, past and present, has developed some form  of map making. However, the appearance of maps, the informatio n that they 
include, and the purposes to which they have been put have all varied dramatically. Moreover, pe ople often reject maps altoget her in favor of travel 
guides, gazetteers and itinerarie s. Once written on paper, thes e now take the form of apps in our  cars and on our phones. In s pite of their diversity, all 
spatial representations encode s ome imagination about the world . All of them reinforce it on be half of some group of people, a nd frequently at the 
expense of some others. This cou rse explores how people have de picted the world, and with what consequences, from the stone ca rvings of the 
Neolithic era to the global positioning systems of today. In th is course, students will create paper and digital maps, write p apers, make presentations 
and engage in discussion in order  to: 1) Reveal that representa tion of the world and its constituent places is historically an d culturally specific. 2) 
Demonstrate how every mode of spatial representation reinforces  particular social interests. 3) Detail how particular maps and  changes in 
cartographic technique s have changed histor y. 4) Describe trans formations in cartography and th e way that they result from new  technologies, 
politics, and ideologies.

HIST 1226 - EASTERN EUROPEAN  COMMUNISM AT THE MOVIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
After the 1917 revolution in Russi a, Lenin famously said: "to u s film is the most important of al l the arts." Communists were to use cinema for 
propaganda purposes, in order to carry out massive state-wide c ampaigns aiming to bring radical s ocial change. However, Soviet  avant-garde 
filmmakers were also concerned with revolutionizing filmmaking itself. Some three decades after Lenin's remarks, the leaders o f the countries of 
Eastern Europe which had become "Soviet satellites" after World  War II, attempted to use censorship and control over the arts and cinema to produce 
effective propaganda for their own political campaigns. Writers , artists, and filmmakers were coveted allies of these new comm unist regimes that 
came to power in the 1940s. Again, however, f ilmmakers and acto rs did not always toe the Party line. Some were able to use fil m to craft complex 
works with subtle messages portray ing aspects of daily life as it was experienced by ordinary p eople under the new regimes. Fi lms that we will watch 
and analyze, released in Hungary , Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia in the decades  before the fall of communism in 1989 managed 
to depict, evoke, and criticize "really existing communism." Th is course will trace the history of East European communism and  of East European 
film-making from 1944 to 1990, ac quainting students with exampl es from an exceptional body of cin ematographic work together wi th the broad 
outlines of East European history . Students will learn to "read " films from 20th century Eastern Europe in their cultural, pol itical, and historical 
context.

HIST 1476 - RELIGION AND HEALING IN CHINA 
Minimum Credits:  3

This course examines the major t raditions and themes that const itute religion in China. The orig ins and development of Confuci anism, Daoism, 
Buddhism, popular and family relig ion, and religion and the sta te are presented within an overall historical framework. As Chi na becomes more and 
more central to the world's modern commodity culture, some have  predicted a decline in traditional religious values and practi ces. In fact, the reverse 
is true: from Taiwan and Hong K ong through mainland China, incr easing prosperity is resulting in  an increased "investment" in religion. In addition 
to the study of religious ideas, practices, and in stitutions in  premodern China, the course e nds by looking at contemporary be liefs and practices and 
issues of politics, class, and ge nder. Our purpose is to gain s ome exposure to Chine se religious thought and practice, to iden tify dominant themes 
underlying Chinese values and be havior, and to explore the sync retic nature of religion in Chi na as each tradition finds expre ssion in and comes to 
influence other aspects of Chinese religion and culture. In thi s way, we hope to come to underst and the critical role played b y the various traditions in 
the unfolding of Chinese history  and in the formation of the Ch inese view of the world.

HIST 1632 - THE HISTORY OF T HE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
Minimum Credits:  3

One of the most celebrated periods of U.S. history, the Civil R ights Movement has been the s ubject of countle ss books, memoirs , and film s. These 
narratives, however, have privile ged certain individuals and in terpretations over others. This course challenges  some of the m yths, 
misrepresentations, and omission s in mainstream representations  of the movement. While we will examine the significant contrib utions of key 
figures such as Martin Luther Ki ng, Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcol m X, the course will also uncover  many of the lesser-known indi viduals who 
confronted racial discriminatio n and fought to secure civil and  human rights for black people in  the United States. Beginning in the 1940s and 
moving through the 1970s, the cour se explores several key areas  of inquiry including the role o f religion, gender, class and s exuality in shaping the 
movement; the si gnificance of internationa l historical developm ents; the growth of freedom strugg les in the urban North; and t he use of armed 
resistance in the movement. 1510

Minimum Credits:  3

August Wilson is recogni zed as one of America' s leading playwri ghts. His plays form part of Am erica's literary canon. Wilson w anted his cycle of 
ten plays - each set in Pittsburgh in a different decade of the  twentieth century - to provide a  chronicle of the black urban experience. At the same 
time, the protagonists of Wilson's plays, as he himself once sa id, "all come out of me, they are - probably - the different as pects of my personality." 
This course will enable students to grapple with two questions coming out of this: (1) to what extent Wilson's plays re-create  the twentieth-century 
urban black experience; and (2) t he extent to which, rather, th e plays reflect Wilson's  own identity and persona.

HIST 1731 - THE HISTORY OF GOD 
Minimum Credits:  3

God has a history. In the earliest days of  that history, God wa s worshiped as one of a plethora of deities controlling various  spheres of cosmic activity 
or the human world. S tudents in this course will learn about th is ancient pantheon - how gods f unctioned in society and how th eir presence was 
experienced by those de voted to them. They will then trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in the 
late second millennium  BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a sm all group of absolute monotheists  based in Jerusalem in the mid -first millennium 
BCE. Students will become more s ophisticated readers of biblica l texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect  not a homogeneous 
monotheism, but rather a divers e set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polyt heism. By appropriating and rein terpreting the 
religious myths of their neighbor s, the Israelit es arrived at a  character of the divine that has proven problematic to many co ntemporary theologians, 
particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.

global status since its inception in the ancient Mediterranean world in the first century CE. Stemming from Paul's fateful dec ision to evangelize the 
Gentiles, Christianity has long s ought to achieve a global netw ork of believers, who  now comprise about 20% of the world's pop ulation. We will 
study Christian globali zation in the twentieth and twenty-first  centuries and focus on two Christian traditions, Catholicism a nd Pentecostalism, as 
examples of religions that have deliberately and successfully g lobalized. We will ask if the c ontemporary values of and plural ism relativism are good 
for religions and religious peopl e. And, where religion is no l onger a powerful cultural force, w hat are the prospects for a p urely humanitarian 
approach to common problems in a globalizing world?

pressing contemporary issues in many countries, including the U nited States, but issues of reli gious diversity and questions o f whether and how to 
tolerate religious minorities h ave a long history. In this cour se, we will examine the toleration of minority religions in par ticular historical settings, 
and the issues and problems (bot h doctrinal and social/politica l) that societies grappled with as they confronted diverse reli gious landscap es. We will 
also use these historical precedents as a lens to examine conte mporary examples of religious pluralism, diversity, and conflic t. Case studies will

HIST 1740 - BUDDHIST MEDITATIVE TRADITIONS 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Buddhist meditation is perhaps  the best known of all Buddhist p ractices particularly in Western countries. In both Asia and th e West, it has been 
popularized in recent ti mes as a technique th at can be used for  such secular purposes as reducin g stress and managing eating d isorders. But what is 
Buddhist meditation? H ow it is practiced i n its traditional con texts? What are the doctrinal foundations of meditation practic es? What are the 
traditional purposes of practic ing Buddhist medit ation? What ar e the various types of meditatio n explained in Buddhist texts? How this practice 
evolved over time in different ge ographical regions in Asia? Wh at are the roles of Buddhist or state institutions in shaping m editation practices? 
Focusing on these questions, this  course examines the breath of  Buddhist meditation pr actices and their his torical evolution a nd transmission in Asian 
Buddhist countries. The course cove rs the role of meditation in  early Indian Buddhism, t he development of different types of m editation in 
Theravadan Buddhist countries, t he emergence of the Chan school  of meditation in China and its  transmission to Japan (Zen), th e appropriation of 
tantra to Buddhist practices in Tibetan Buddhism, and the moder nization of Buddhist med itational practices during the colonial  period. The course is 
taught using classical Buddhist tex ts and meditati onal manuals in translation, seconda ry studies, testimonials and films. In t he process, we expect to 
enhance our familiarity with relig ious practices and our unders tanding of the human experience.

HIST 1768 - CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS JEW S IN THE MIDDLE AGES: CONNECT ION & CONFLICT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Was the world of Europe and the Middle East before the Enlighte nment a period of unending relig ious conflict and intolerance? Were Jews the 
victims of severe persecution an d violence everywhere during th is period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing relig ious wars? The 
answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict a nd competition between the thre e major western 
religious groups, they were also  a time of coexi stence and coop eration. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplis tic stereotypes to 
deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were t he theological, politi cal, and legal contex ts in which Christia ns, Muslims, and Jews 
interacted in both Christian Euro pe and the Musli m world? How d id these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tole rate the religious 
"Other"? When and why did tolera tion break down and lead to exp ulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cul tural exchanges and 
cooperation take place in economi c, cultural, int ellectual, and  social life? We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and  intolerance) that emerged 
at the end of the Middle Ages and  examine aspects of inter-reli gious encounters and dialogues to day. We will discuss not only the significance of 
Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but als o assess these encounters as a case study in the broader histor y of religious diversity, 
pluralism, and conflict.

HIST 1780 - JEWS AND THE CITY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Comedian Lenny Bruce riffed in  1963 that "If you live in New Yo rk or any other big city, you ar e Jewish. It doesn't matter eve n if you're Catholic; if 
you live in New York you're Jewish. " In this course, we will di scover why Lenny Bruce -- and so many other observers of Jewish  life -- came to 
understand urbanity as a core com ponent of the Jewish experienc e. We will begin our study of the Jewish encounter with urban l ife in the 19th 
century, as millions of Eastern European Jews migrated from the  small villages of their birth to cities across the globe. This  course will trace this 
Eastern European Jewish diaspor a to urban destinations around t he world, before training its len s on the Jewish encounter with  American cities. We 
will pay close attention to how p atterns of Jewish urbanization  changed regionally and over time ; how urbanization affected Je ws' home-life, leisure 
time, religious practices and occupational choices; how differe nces in gender and class affect ed Jews' experiences in urban sp aces; and how Jews 
interacted with other ethnic grou ps in diverse, urban environme nts. Delving into the history, b uilt environment, and archival sources pertaining to the 
Jewish experience in Pittsburgh will provide us with a dynamic case study for this crucial relationship between Jews and the c ity.

HPS 0412 - THE NEWTONIAN REVOLUTION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
In this class we will investigate the transformation of scienti fic concepts by studying the hist orical,philosophical, and scie ntific issues raised by 
Newton's work in optic s and mechanics. We will adopt the method s of integrated history and ph ilosophy of science, whereby unde rstanding is 
improved through a sustained di alogue between historical invest igation and philosophical criti cal reflection upon the processe s and products of a 
scientific enterprise. We will  begin with looking at the tradit ional notion of a revolution in  philosophy of science, and expl ore the applicability of this 
notion to the scientific context of sixteenth and seventeenth c entury England. We will then look closely at the stages in whic h Newton developed the 
theory of universal gravitation . This will provi de the groundwo rk for studying the pivotal trans formation of the concepts of f orce, attraction, and 1529 
 inertia, together with the invention of the concept of mass and  the cultural reorientation su rrounding the nature of the cosmo s as a whole. We will 
then compare and contrast Newton' s work in constructing the the ory of universal gravitation w ith his experimental methods in o ptics. We will then 
explore the legacy of Newton's work in the subsequent experimen tal tests of Newtonian gravita tion, the codification of modern scientific 
methodologies, and in the developm ent of central topics in the philosophy of science.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Mind and medicine deals with fu ndamental problems and questions  that arise in considering the nature of mental health, mental illness, and branches 
of medicine that aim to promote mental health and treat mental illness. We will begin by considering the concepts of 'health',  'disease' and 'illness' in 
general, and several different models of medicine. From there w e will move on to a consideration of the nature of explanation in medicine generally. 
We will examine some explanatory successes in the domain of phy sical health and disease, and consider how those successes were  achieved. In the 
second half of the course we w ill look at controversies over th e question of whether there is su ch a thing as mental illness, and if so, how one is to 
define, diagnose and tr eat it. In order to b etter understand wh at is at stake, we will explore these controversies by focusing  on a specific mental 
illness, schizophrenia. Looking at  recent research on schizophr enia will allow us to  see the extent to which the kind of under standing we have 
achieved in physical medicine is  or is not to be  expected with serious mental illness. Students who successfully complete this  course will be able to 
identify and analyze different philosophical appr oaches to sele cted issues in medicine and psych iatry; have gained insight int o how to read and 
critically interpret philosophica l arguments; and have develope d skills that will en able them to think clearly about foundatio nal questions as future or 
current health care providers, pol icy makers, and consumers. Th is course is also part of a core sequence leading to certificat ion in the Conceptual 
Foundations of Medicine Certificat e Program, and is a companion  course to HPS 0613 (Morality an d Medicine) but may be taken in dependently. The

We have likely all en countered arguments i n which sweeping clai ms are made about the relationshi p between religion and science . These claims 
often generalize on the basis of a limited knowledge of a few l ocally visible religious tradi tions. This course offers student s an opportunity to explore 
the way science has interacted with some of the traditions ofte n neglected by these debates. In particular, we will explore ho w the close relationship 
between European imperialism and scientific institutions create d new parameters for conversa tions about Hindu and Buddhist tra ditions. This led 
intellectuals in these traditi ons to develop systems of thought  that integrate scientific and r eligious ideas. These ideas pla yed an important role in 
processes of decolonization, the  development of religious natio nalism, and the transnational sp read of Hindu and Buddhist trad itions.

Minimum Credits:  3

Consider classic philosophical questions concerning knowledge o f the external world, free will, time, ethics, language, and ma ny more. The 
philosophical tradition has writte n many enlightening things on  these topics. However, these ar e all questions t hat have also been examined by 
another rich traditi on: science-fic tion. While philosophy proce eds by careful argumentation and theory-building, science-ficti on proceeds by 
imagining worlds very different from ours that are governed by their own internal logic and sees  how stories play out in these  worlds. In this way the 
two disciplines---science ficti on and philosophy---are compleme ntary. The goal of thi s course is to study both these tradition s together so as to 
illuminate these classic philosophical questions. We will see h ow philosophical arguments become  sharper when considered in th e context of stories. 
We will investigate how our int uitions about phi losophical prob lems change when confronted with stories. Hopefully, we will ha ve a gained a clearer 
understanding of philosophical ques tions and gained a more crit ical eye for viewing or reading science fiction. Most important ly, we will have 
developed the ability to write out our thoughts clearly and dev elop and defend philosophical arguments.

It is generally agreed that what h appened in the 17th century c hanged the human landscape irrevocably. The religious reformati on was consolidated; 
divinely ordained kingship was d ecisively uprooted; upheavals a cross Europe ushered in non-trad itional political  and constitut ional formations; and 
the forces of transformation forged new sociocultural contexts in which life was lived. Lying at the core of these transformat ions was the impact of 
early modern science as it emerged in the 17th century. This co urse will examine the dynamics of  the `scientific revolution' p aying close attention to 
such figures as Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Hobbes, Leibniz, an d Newton. We will be concerned w ith the philosophical consequen ces of their thought 1536

A prominent company recently realized the machine-learning algo rithm trained on its past hiring d ata had learned a bias agains t female candidates 
and so was unsuitable for resume  evaluation. But given competin g definitions of fairness, how s hould we decide what it means f or an algorithm to be 
unbiased? Machine vision algorithm s are systematically less lik ely to recognize faces of peopl e of color. Since many face reco gnition algorithms are 
used for surveillance , would improving these algorithms promote  justice? Deep fakes may pose serious challenges to democratic discourse, as faked 
videos of political leaders making incendiary statements cast d oubt on the provenance of real vi deos. Do the researchers devel oping these algorithms, 
often academics funded by Nationa l Science Foundation grants, h ave an obligation to desist? In a field filled with such vexing  questions, the ethical 
issue most commonly a ddressed by the media is whether a self-dr iving car should swerve to hit on e person to avoi d hitting two.  In this class, we will

HPS 1670 - PHILOSOPHY OF NEUROSCIENCE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
How can neuroscience explain my subjective experiences? How are  the mind and brain connected? Do  neuroscience and psychology e ven relate? Is 
there a problem of consciousness? Can we read minds? These are some of the questions now occup ying the minds of both philosoph ers of 
neuroscience and many neuroscien tists. However, approaching suc h questions empirically does not reveal the underlying assumpti ons one might 
incorporate into one's thinki ng when formulating questions, dev eloping experiments, and interpr eting results. This course will  couple metaphysical 
theories of mind with contemporary research in both cognitive n euroscience and neurobiology. T hroughout the class, we will try  to answer some of 
the questions that popularly occu py contemporary philosophy of neuroscience debates, as well as interrogate and identify, phil osophically, where and 
how these questions, including the  research they prompt, arose in the first place. Finally, as neuroscience is a largely tool- driven discipline, students 
will learn about a range of neuro technologies and explore wheth er or not these technologies are likely to get us any closer to  reading the mind from 
the brain. Background in neuro science is not required.

HPS 1671 - PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDAT IONS OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
An overview of the rise of cogniti ve science as an interdiscipl inary field, and the fundamental debates it has engendered. Cog nitive science emerged 
in the twentieth century as a pa radigm for studying the mind. S ince its beginning, cognitive science has drawn upon formal dev elopments in 
philosophy, logic, mathematics, a nd computer science in order t o establish various frameworks fo r generating and testing theor ies of cognition. It has 
sought to integrate, as well as further, the empirical findings  of psychology, linguistics, anth ropology, and neuroscience. Th e premises behind this 
ambitious approach have given rise to significant philosophical  discussion. The first half of the  course will introduce studen ts to philosophical and 
empirical developments within the individual disciplines relate d to cognitive science and will s how how they interrelate. The second half of the 
course is devoted to the central debates: classical computation alism versus connectionism; nativ ism versus empiricism; represe ntationalism versus 
anti-representationalism; bottom- up versus top-down approaches;  the rationality wars; and so on

HAA 0018 - DEATH IN THE ANCIENT WORLD 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrenc e that provokes a variety of hum an responses. In addition to wr itings describing their 
funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterran ean region have left artistic rep resentations of death and dyin g, built tombs , and objects 
associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, ima ges, structures, and objects a llows us to bette r understand anc ient attitudes and reactions 
to death. This undergraduate lec ture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary pra ctices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and 
Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. F irst, we will explore how archaeo logists discover death-related  artifacts and how 
scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death  rituals. Ancient practices and b eliefs regarding the mummifica tion, the funeral, 
commemorative strategies, visits to the grave, and the afterlif e will be explored, and images found on sp ecific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, 
paintings) will be discussed in depth. The course will conclude  with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fe ar of the undead (zombies, 
vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial con tests and public executions), pla yed in ancient  Mediterranean c ivilizations.

HAA 0042 - WORLD CITIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Cities have existed all over the world for millennia, and their  inhabitants have used these ur ban conglomerations to connect t hemselves, t heir ideas, 
and their goods to a much wider  audience - often well beyond th eir geographic and political bo undaries. Cities h ave also been sites of dramatic 
demographic changes throughout hum an history, leading to produc tive contact as well as structura l inequalities between diverse  peoples. In this 
course, students will explore how  cities all over the world and  through time have grappled with t he potentials and problems of  a growing, 
diversifying, and increasingly interconnected wor ld. We will pa y particular attention to the ci ties' heterogeneous inhabitants , their built and natural 
environments, their interconnect ivity, and their different and changing identities as "world c ities." Designed around guest le ctures by faculty from the 
Department of History of Art and  Architecture, this course will  introduce students to a wide a rray of world cities. Weekly lec tures will explore 
examples of cities across time and space, including Timbuktu, M exico City, Beijing, Chicago, Istanbul, Cairo, Paris, and other  sites; and through a 
variety of visual media, includi ng architecture, public sculptu re, photography, and film. Class sessions will be specifically devoted to comparing the 
ideas that formed these cities and how their identities and bui lt environments have changed over time.

HAA 0065 - THE VIRAL IMAGE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course will employ both hist orical and contemporary frames  to come to terms with what it means for an image to "go viral"  and why that virality 
matters. Using this lens, we will be able to concern ourselves with how images have functioned through time as a  conceptual si te of contradiction and 
competing claims to knowledge and power. Ta king a historic view , the class will examine what it meant for an image to propagat e, erupt, and also 
stay latent in different epochs, such as the age of the printin g press and with the  emergence of photogra phy. This historical perspective will in turn 
enable us to contextualize the role(s) that "viral images" take  up in the intensely v isual and networked digital infrastructur e of the twenty-first 
century. From this conversation, w e hope to draw forward import ant distinctions that arise from the term itself, such as the d ifference between 
"virality" and a "shared visual tradition." Disciplinarily, the re is a difference between a "viral image," and an image with " staying power" that 
becomes part of and eventually comes to reinforce a visual trad ition, and this course will inve stigate both the contours of th is distinction and its 
implications. We will consider viral properties such as propaga tion, contagion, latency, and er uption alongside visual meaning -making, community-
building, and human s ocial connection.

Minimum Credits:  3

This course surveys the  Western origins of museums, world's fai rs, and biennials in the 19th cen tury and traces the increasing ly global development 
of exhibitions of visual and mat erial culture up through the pr esent day. Our focus in this long and varied history will be on  those shows that have 
sought, not without controversy, t o shape viewers' knowledge of  the past, while also structuring their sense of self and relat ionship to others in 
national, international , universal, and/or g lobal terms. We'll critically assess the motivations  behind these exhibitions and the changing "world 
picture" each presented in rela tion to modernizing and globaliz ing tendencies of the past two centuries. We'll also take a clo se look not only at what 
these shows presented, but also how and for what purpose(s) our  chosen exhibitions were organized. Whose worldview, ideology, and/or political 
interests did they serve? How in each case did the very arrange ment of objects and the physical  context of their presentation seek to articulate those 
interests? What sort of public d id they envision and attempt to  create? We'll also address how a nd to what extent the achievem ents and shortcomings 
of earlier exhibitions have inform ed the character of subsequen t shows down to today. Throughout  the course, we'll measure our  understanding of 
this history against local exa mples of Pittsburgh's rich and ex tensive museum culture. Written assignments will involve studen ts in exploring these 
and other local installations as we assess what role museums ca n and should continue to play i n fostering understanding of our selves and others now 
and into the future.

HAA 1050 - WORLD ART:CONTACT AND CONFLICT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course, an advanced undergra duate seminar, is a counterpar t to the introductory core cour se Introduction to World Art and  invites students to 
think more critically about 'Worl d Art' as a disciplinary enter prise as it emerged in the last several decades with the global  turn, post-colonialism, and 
a call for art history to be more inclusive. Students will be i ntroduced to key terms that are employed by this discourse (con tact zones, planetarity, 
world-picturing, cosmopolitanis m). The course works through the se ideas by focusing its attent ion on specific s ites and art ob jects, case studies that 
explicitly circulate within or take as their subject the meetin g point of different cultures and groups. First and foremost, t his course regards `the 
contact zone' as a messy and co mplicated place. To inhabit the earth as a human being, people en counter, perceive, collaborate  with and often resist 
others. Through the spaces and ma terial objects humans create, boundaries are established and in dividuals and communities are defined and 
circumscribed. Art obj ects and constructed spaces not only aris e from but define the contact point of individuals or groups oc cupying different 
worlds. By studying these works as a space of en counter, studen ts will learn that boundaries b etween people are porous, with c ultural contact a zone 
of potentially productive collabor ation but also power inequity  and strife. How do works of art and built spaces incite, media te, or instantiate such 
strife? How have people traditionally perceived to reside at th e periphery employed artistic e xpression or rhetorical strategi es to subvert existing 
power structures (the center) and  formulate identity? Students who have taken the HAA 0010 Intr oductory version of this course  are encouraged to 
take this more advanced version , but it is not necessary to hav e had HAA 0010 to enr oll in HAA 1050

everything from the extermination of the Jews to sexuality and the war effort. We shall also cons ider the impact of the purge of modern art under 
Hitler on the work of such noted  modernists as Otto Dix and Kth e Kollwitz, who chose to remain in  Germany, and on the art of t hose who fled into 
exile, among them John Heartfie ld, George Grosz, and Max Beckma nn. The final weeks of the course will consider critical issues  involved in recent-
-and invariably controversial--attempts in museum building, scu lpture, and site-specific insta llations to memorialize the Holo caust and examine

of the many forms of Black resis tance to racism and systemic in justices. In doing so, Black ha nds and Black minds shaped the v ery fabric of 
America's landscape. Our class begins and ends in Washington DC , posing important questions ab out the hidden and overt symbols  of Black heritage 
in the nation's capital.

HUN 1615 - OUTSIDERS ON THE MARGIN S: THE AFTERMATH  OF SOCIALISM  ON FILM 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course introduces students to the aftermath of Socialism, focusing on East Germany and Hung ary through movies. We will lo ok at issues that 
have been specific to societies in the Eastern Bloc taking thes e two areas as examples, and t hus offer insight into the develo pment of these societies 
after the fall of Socialism all the way up to the present. A de eper understanding of this devel opment will encourage students to think about current 
historical-political events from a broader compar ative perspect ive, promote their knowledge about  the region of East Central E urope, and help 
discuss these events in an informed manner. Film as an art refl ects the struggles and preoccupa tions of the time and society i t emerges from. The 
selection of films in this course  provides students with a repr esentative sample of issues that take center stage in movies ab out the shift from 
Socialism to Capitalism and the aftermath of this transition. C ourse readings and class discussi ons illuminate the historical and cultural background 
to the cinematographic pieces watched and discussed in the cour se. The movies, readings and class discussions provide insight into how Socialism 
shaped society and what ramifications it has for the further co urse of history after its collap se in 1989. More than thirty ye ars after the official end of 
Socialism, the repercussions of the "cursed forty years" are st ill palpable in people's lives, their collective memory, societ al issues and the way they 
influence domestic and foreign politics. Under Socialism, inhab itants of the Eastern Bloc largely remained isolated from the C apitalist world and thus 
remained outsiders to it, quasi-exotic beings who were often re garded with curiosity, pity or su spicion by those in the West. These sentiments are still 
echoed despite the collapse of S ocialism in 1989  and the EU's E astern Enlargement in 2004, as in habitants of bot h the former E astern Bloc countries 
and the Western world are still coming to terms with East Centr al Europe's transformation into democratic societies with a fre e market economy and 
the free movement of labor. Historical and cultural differences  that had existed before the cre ation of the Iron Curtain did n ot cease to be  in the Post-
Socialist era; on the contrary, they precipitate in discussions  and policy-making in the EU and  at a global level, where membe rs of the Visegrád 
countries and their former East ern Bloc neighbors are yet again  often regarded as the nonconfor mist outsiders on the margins o f Europe. In an era of 
globalization, would we not exp ect mutual understanding of each  other to be less problematic t han before the change in 1989? W hat is the connection 
between forty years of Socialism and our current day in a Post- Socialist era? We will investig ate issues of economic disparity , gender, sexuality, race, 
ethnicity, ability difference and criminality through a selecti on of cinematographic works ma de after 1989 presenting the effe ct of the change on 
people's lives from various perspectives. Some of these include  the perspective of women, homosexuals, Jews, migrants, people with disabilities, and

Hungary today is a key site for competing plans for state- and peoplehood in the European Union. The country is also critical for making sense of the 
relationship between Europe's im perial-colonial legacies, Centr al Europe's capitalist and (post) socialist transformations, and  EU integration, while 
providing deeper insight into the global issues of 'politics fr om below,' human rights and secu rity, and migration. This is an  interdisciplinary course 
taught by a visiting H ungarian Fulbright dis tinguished scholar.  The content of the course will d epend on the field and researc h of the individual 
scholar, but will typically explore history, culture, politics and / or society from a transna tional and global perspective, f ocusing on contemporary 
Hungary within the broader c ontext of Central Europe.

ITAL 0090 - EURO CHIC: THE  INVENTION OF FASHION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Since the Renaissance, Italy a nd France have occupied a fundame ntal role in the estab lishment and development of fashion as a creative and 
commercial enterprise deeply rooted in cultural mores. The cour se address the historical shifts in the cultural understanding of gender roles, class 
belonging, consumption habits a nd expectations, the internation al circulation of craftmanship and celebrities, and technologic al innovation. We will 
start addressing the anthropology  of body ornamentation, gender  markings and the difference bet ween costume and fashion. Our h istorical point of 
departure is the grand arrival of  Catherine De Medici from Flor ence to Paris in 1547, following her marriage to King Henry II of France. We then 
follow the progressive establishment of Paris as the capital of  European (and eventually inter national) fashion,  together with  Italian cities like 
Florence, Venice and Milan. We also take a significant detour t hrough London during the "dandy" era  of the early 19th century and the "mod" and 
"punk" trends of the decades bet ween 1960 and 1980. Punk leads us into a discussion of current i nternational "anti-fashion" tr ends, such as the 
politics and economics of privilege, cheap labor and environmen tal concerns about "fast fashion."  This course is taught in Eng lish. *This course may 
be used for the Italian Studies  major (whether listed as FR 009 0 or ITAL 0090), but does not coun t for the Italian major or th e Italian minor.

Italy has long been a nation of e migrants, but only in the last  few decades has become a nation receiving large numbers of imm igrants. The fall of 
communism in Eastern Europe, and wars and violence in the Balka ns, across Africa and the Middl e East, have spurred new migrant s towards the 
West in search of safety and economic prosperity. The unique po sition of the Italian peninsula in the Mediterranean has made i t a key territory of 
arrival in these modern-day mig rations, but to wh at advantage a nd to what cost? This course wil l explore the complexities of c ultural identity and 
migration, and the impact they have on intercultural conflict a nd cooperation. There w ill be a particular focus on migration i n Italy and on the 
marginalized communities of contemporary Italy, such as migrant s, their Italianborn non-citizen  children, and the Roma. We wil l examine the 
fluidity of cultural boundaries across time and s pace, and how ingroup and outgroup dynamics contr ibute to the manufacturing o f fear and prejudice 
among populations. During their se mester abroad, students will reflect on the various elements that define a culture while gai ning an increased 
understanding of how culture sha pes individuals  and how our cul tural identities interact in shared social spaces such as the p iazze of Florence. This is

ITAL 1092 - ITALIAN TRANSLATION W ORKSHOP: FROM THEORY TO BEST P RACTICES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Tradurre, tradire. So goes the old Italian saying: to translate  is always a betrayal. What makes translation such a complicate d and risky process? 
What, exactly, is the "betrayal" against? What does this kind o f formulation tell us about how s ociety views source texts (or "originals") and their 
translation into other languages,  formats, and medias? This cou rse examines translation from both a theoretical and practical perspective, allowing 
students to understand the ways in which tr anslation has been f ormulated, promoted, and criticiz ed, but also givi ng them a lab oratory for the 
translation of texts of various  kinds and genres, including let ters, oral histories, publicity materials, literature, and even  film subtitles. Students in this 
class will move from short tran slation exercises to longer tran slation projects, culminating in a multi-piece portfolio of the ir translation projects, 
which will draw on unt ranslated materials from local archives a nd library collections. Pre-requ isites: any tw o of ITAL 0111, 0 113, 0115, 0117, 0119

The myths of the ancie nt near East are am ong the earliest writt en interpretations of the world and human existence. They are a lso among the most 
enduring, although they have only been unearthed in the last 20 0 years. In this cours e, we read myths fro m ancient Mesopotamia , Ugarit, and Israel. 
We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ide as and issues of the original cultural context in which they we re shaped. These myths 
offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient near east, as well as societal and political issues. We examine them es such as the  presentation 
of the life of the gods, the rel ationship between the human and  divine worlds, the issues of mortality and immortality, existe nce, fertility, kingship, 
and ethics. The primary goal of  this course is to better unders tand these myths as they existed and developed in their ancient  settings. Of course, 
because the myths are expressions of human thought, we may find  that in studying them we also co me to better understand oursel ves.

JS 0115 - BIBLE AS LITERATURE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
While the Bible can be read in many ways with many different go als, the focus of this course is:  reading and examining the Bib le as a literary text, 
or, more accurately, as a collec tion of widely diverse literary  texts. Therefore, the questions we ask of the biblical texts w ill pertain primarily to their 
forms, interests, and historical  contexts. Most of this course will focus on narrative portions  of the Bible , although we will  see how other literary 
forms are often interwoven thro ughout the Bible's stories. Amon g the topics and issues  we will consider in  this course are: th e origins of biblical texts 
and their historical contexts; th e Bible's own representations of history, particularly the hist ory of Israel; the nature of G od throughout the Bible; 
human-divine relations and covenants; different critical approa ches to the text (e.g., source criticism, redaction criticism);  the figure of Jesus; uses of 
the Hebrew Bible in the New Testament; apocalyptic literature; and the various themes, motifs, a nd literary forms that bring t hese issues together. 
Throughout the semester we will al so look at different uses of the Bible as a way of illuminatin g the Bible as a  work of liter ature. Such uses will 
include different translations or paraphrases of the Bible, var ious representations of biblical  narratives, and examples of th e Bible in contemporary 
popular culture.

JS 1048 - THE HOLOCAUST IN CONTEXT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
"Ethnic cleansing" and "genocide" are neither twentieth-century  phenomena, nor is their occurre nce linked to any particular re gion in the world. 
However, during the two world wars and their aftermath acts the  civilian population of Central and Eastern Europe experienced a degree of mass 
violence that not only changed to  face of the region but also l ed to the establishmen t of the very term "genocide". The Holoca ust stands out as the 
most comprehensive, most radically executed case of genocide in  modern times. Yet it was embedded  in a wider context of system atic violence 
against various populations in Ce ntral and Eastern Europe. Rath er than beginning with a general, abstract reflection on the re asons for the various 
forms of mass violence  from ethnic cleansing to genocide, this course allows students to explore the specif ic social, cultural , and political conditions 
under which the sometimes entangl ed cases of mass violence agai nst civilians occurred in twentieth-century Central and Eastern  Europe. The course 
concludes with a general reflec tion and discussion of the conce pt of "genocide", the limits of its analytical usefulness, and the political baggage it 
carries.

JS 1102 - THE HISTORY OF GOD 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
God has a history. In the earliest days of  that history, God wa s worshiped as one of a plethora of deities controlling various  spheres of cosmic activity 
or the human world. S tudents in this course will learn about th is ancient pantheon - how gods f unctioned in society and how th eir presence was 
experienced by those de voted to them. They will then trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in the 
late second millennium  BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a sm all group of absolute monotheists  based in Jerusalem in the mid -first millennium 
BCE. Students will become more s ophisticated readers of biblica l texts in the process. The sources of the Hebrew Bible reflect  not a homogeneous 
monotheism, but rather a divers e set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polyt heism. By appropriating and rein terpreting the 
religious myths of their neighbor s, the Israelit es arrived at a  character of the divine that has proven problematic to many co ntemporary theologians, 
particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and the environment.

JS 1170 - ARCHAEOLOGY OF ISRAEL-PALESTINE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Is archaeology in a place like Israel-Palestine an objective sc ience? In this course , we explore how past and present are link ed as nation-states and 
religious communities utilize the archaeological record to mold  identities and to forward cer tain narratives. Our focus will b e on the major 
archaeological sites of Israel-Palestine, particularly in Jerus alem and its environs. We will e xplore the political and religi ous issues that have emerged 
from or surround their excavation . Archaeology in the Holy Land  has long been driven by a desir e to shed light on-or even auth enticate-the Bible, 
while the "exotic Orient" was explored in the 19th and early 20 th centuries through western exp editions and excavations that s erved to further 
colonial interests. These religious and political motivations p ersist even if their manifestations have shifted with time. Thr ough site tours, museum 
visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even a day participating in an archaeological excavation, stude nts will gai n direct 
experience with the places that  have aroused controversy becaus e of their problematic relations hip to biblical and other ancie nt texts and/or because 
of their location in polit ically contested space.

Minimum Credits:  3

Comedian Lenny Bruce riffed in  1963 that "If you live in New Yo rk or any other big city, you ar e Jewish. It doesn't matter eve n if you're Catholic; if 
you live in New York you're Jewish. " In this course, we will di scover why Lenny Bruce -- and so many other observers of Jewish  life -- came to 
understand urbanity as a core com ponent of the Jewish experienc e. We will begin our study of the Jewish encounter with urban l ife in the 19th 
century, as millions of Eastern European Jews migrated from the  small villages of their birth to cities across the globe. This  course will trace this 
Eastern European Jewish diaspor a to urban destinations around t he world, before training its len s on the Jewish encounter with  American cities. We 
will pay close attention to how p atterns of Jewish urbanization  changed regionally and over time ; how urbanization affected Je ws' home-life, leisure 
time, religious practices and occupational choices; how differe nces in gender and class affect ed Jews' experiences in urban sp aces; and how Jews 
interacted with other ethnic grou ps in diverse, urban environme nts. Delving into the history, b uilt environment, and archival sources pertaining to the 
Jewish experience in Pittsburgh will provide us with a dynamic case study for this crucial relationship between Jews and the c ity.

the Shoah in Israeli literature and the Nakba in Palestinian li terature. The course will equall y focus on developing students'  academic and reflective 
writing skills. Students will pro duce a combination of literary  analysis and self-reflective writing that uses techniques of c reative nonfiction.

What is the best way to accommodate religious and cultural dive rsity within a nation-state and in civil society? How should in dividual rights to 
practice religion be balanced w ith communal needs? Should freed om from religion be protected as much or more than freedom of r eligion? These are 
pressing contemporary issues in many countries, including the U nited States, but issues of reli gious diversity and questions o f whether and how to 
tolerate religious minorities h ave a long history. In this cour se, we will examine the toleration of minority religions in par ticular historical settings, 
and the issues and problems (bot h doctrinal and social/politica l) that societies grappled with as they confronted diverse reli gious landscap es. We will 
also use these historical precedents as a lens to examine conte mporary examples of religious pluralism, diversity, and conflic t. Case studies will 
mainly be drawn from pre-modern  Europe and modern Europe and No rth America, but we will also look at Mugha l and modern India a nd discuss 
religion in pre-modern China.

JS 1644 - CHRISTIAN MUSLIMS JEWS IN THE MIDDLE AGES: CONNECTION  & CONFLICT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Was the world of Europe and the Middle East before the Enlighte nment a period of unending relig ious conflict and intolerance? Were Jews the 
victims of severe persecution an d violence everywhere during th is period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing relig ious wars? The 
answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict a nd competition between the thre e major western 
religious groups, they were also  a time of coexi stence and coop eration. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplis tic stereotypes to 1645 
 deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were t he theological, politi cal, and legal contex ts in which Christia ns, Muslims, and Jews 
interacted in both Christian Euro pe and the Musli m world? How d id these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tole rate the religious 
"Other"? When and why did tolera tion break down and lead to exp ulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cul tural exchanges and 
cooperation take place in economi c, cultural, int ellectual, and  social life? We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and  intolerance) that emerged 
at the end of the Middle Ages and  examine aspects of inter-reli gious encounters and dialogues to day. We will discuss not only the significance of 
Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but als o assess these encounters as a case study in the broader histor y of religious diversity, 
pluralism, and conflict.

how criminal justice compares w ith other institutions of social  control/welfare (e.g. the education system). We also learn and  apply major approaches 
to law & society in order to int errogate broader issues concern ing law's intersection with socie tal values, power, and inequal ity. In so doing, we

 Minimum Credits:  3

That "justice is blind" is a central value and claim of crimina l justice institutions, and modern legal systems more generally . This course takes a 
mainly historical approach to ex amine the overt and subtle ways  that this blindness has been co mpromised by being commodified,  gendered, and 
racialized. In terms of overt c lass boundaries, this 'blindness ' emerged with the rise of the nation-state, but it was long ge ndered and racialized in 
overt ways and commodified in mo re subtle ones. Since roughly t he 1960s, the U.S. has been in an  era where  all three social bo undaries impinge on 
law's blindness in ways that tend to be more subtle than overt.  Using a social boundary approach , students in this course will  learn these historical 
trajectories to the present as a foundation for thinking critic ally about criminal justice, the legal system, and contemporary  social inequality more 
generally. A major focus is law's  relationship to  inequalities based on race, cl ass, and gender. Topics  covered include slaver y, Jim Crow, the 
development of formal equality  under the law, affirmative actio n, and the commodification of legal rights.

disallowing certain forms of gov ernmental and non-governmental action aimed at supporting or vio lating what today are recogniz ed as civil rights. 
We will give attention to the role of civil and/or criminal lia bility in civil rights protections , and how this role relates t o the legal system's approach to 
other socially defined harms. Mo re broadly, this course conside rs the relationship be tween civil rights laws and various forms  of group membership 
(e.g., sex/gender, race, citizenship ) and types of rights (e.g ., religion, speech, education, privacy).

Certain cultural concerns are well-labeled linguistically: kins hip, plant-names, diseases, colo rs, etc. The study of how such semantic fields are labeled 
and organized is ethnosemantics. Much of the way language is us ed depends on the context of spe aking. Different ways of talkin g to different people 
is the subject matter of sociolinguistics. Some thoughts that w e habitually think seem illogical on reflection, but it seems a s if our language 
predisposes us to think this wa y. Such phenomena are addressed by the sapir-whorf hypothesis.

The first goal of this course is to familiarize students with t he major statistical tests, analy sis strategies, and plotting c onventions that are currently 
considered best practices in lin guistics. The course accomplish  these goals through a combinat ion of reading (both of textbook  chapters and empirical 
articles), in-class demos and ha nds-on practice, and homework e xercises. The second goa l is to make student s comfortable using  the R programming 
language for statistical computin g. Assuming absolutely no prio r background in statistics or pr ogramming, we will work from th e ground up to turn 
you into a novice but proficient statistical programmer; by the  end of this course, you will be able to read in your own data,  perform basic data re-
formatting and summary calculati ons, and conduct a wide variety  of statistical analyses' all in R! The final goal is to get st udents thinking about how 
they can apply their new skills to their own research. In servi ce of this goal, you will be re quired to write a short research  paper that describes a data 
set you would like to work with, and that explains the statisti cal analyses you would perform i n order to answer a small numbe r of questions that are 
of interest to you.

emerged as a valuable asset to a ll the parties i nvolved (e.g., firms, governments, consumers, a nd players). The course is orga nized into two themes; 1) 
sports as product and 2) sports a s medium. The first theme focu ses on the applications of market ing theories and principles to  promote sports and 
sport related products. It puts t he students in the shoes of a marketing manager of a sports r elated business . The second them e, on the other hand, 
considers sports as one of the vehicles to prom ote a product or  service. It covers how non-spor t related busine sses can benefi t from utilizing sports as 
a part of their marketing commu nication program. Another area t hat will be discussed throughout the course is the role of ethi cs in sports marketing. 
What we sell in both sports as product and sports as medium is the positive values that sports r epresent. Therefore, sports of ten serve as a platform to 
promote the core values of our s ociety and introduce positive c hange. This unique nature of spor ts marketing provides us with an opportunity to 
integrate the business aspects of sports and ethi cal perspectiv es in its marketing. Issues such as gambling, Title IX, perform ance enhancing drugs, and 
social responsibilities of sports  organizations will be discuss ed in length whenever it is relevant to the course material.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Extensive uses of composites can be seen in several aspects of engineering applicat ions. Industrial sector s, such as in wind t urbines, oil and natural 
gas exploration and production, n atural gas and hydrogen vehicl e storage tanks, high-speed and p recision machinery, etc., are today the largest user 
of composites, surpassing aerosp ace industries. Other applicati ons are in semiconductor manufact uring equipment; automobile en gines, bodies, 
brakes and clutches; energy stor age flywheels; gas turbine engi nes; process industries equipment;  data storage equipment; medi cal diagnostic 
equipment; prosthetics  and orthotics, etc. The advantages of co mposite materials stem from thei r outstanding strengths and sti ffnesses, low densities, 
in addition to their unique and tailorable physical properties,  including good thermal conductivities compared to copper and t hermal expansions that 
can be varied from high to near zero. Composites, such as metal lic, ceramic and car bon materials have both high-temperature an d low-temperature 
capabilities, making them useful in high temperature regimes, e .g. in gas turbine engines, autom obile and aircraft brakes. Thi s course offers an in-
depth presentation of design, a nalysis and manufacturing method s for composites, with particular reference to polymer matrix c omposites. For an 
efficient use of composites in l ightweight structural design ap plications, this course offers t he needed fundamental understan ding of the structure, 
properties, and mechanics of com posite materials. A typical mec hanical analysis and design of co mposite structures, which are significantly more 
complex than those of their metallic equivalents due to the ani sotropic nature of laminated composite materials, will be prese nted.

about various ways of experienci ng music. We are interested in developing critical skills to experience, analyze, and apprecia te the myriad musical 
styles and contexts you will encounter over a lifetime of liste ning. To that end, this class is focused totally on the act of critical, experiential listening, 
how to do it, informed listening , and what it can tell the list ener's not only about a piece of music, but about the culture a nd society that created that 
music, as well as the challenges faced by the increasing ubiqui ty of music in our world. You  do not need a musical background to have a successful

blues) were more than music, that jazz (and blues) had ubiquito usly infiltrated American life, and that it serv ed as a model f or an expanding pluralist 
culture. Jazz and Film explores t his notion in three areas: in representations of jazz culture  on film, in the  sonic presence of jazz in film, and the 
influence of jazz on filmmaking. Students will give weekly resp onses to readings, films, or reco rdings, and will write a resea rch paper on a topic of 
their own choosing.

MUSIC 1308 - CULTURAL POLITICS OF SOUL 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This is an introductory level c ourse which examines soul music as a lived cultural practice, an artistic genre, a transnationa l phenomenon, and an 
important historical site for the articulation of gender, race and class in both American popu lar culture and the African dias pora. Special attention is 
placed on the transitions and par allels of "soul" as a musical genre, with "soul" as a marker of cultural politics and identit y. As a musical genre, 
"soul" was first recognized as th e secular reinvention of the S outhern, gospel tradition, acti ng as a soundtrack to the Civil Rights Movement. Once 
the Black community merged this m usic with the ideals of Black radical politics, it transforme d the popular genre into an urba n practice of "Soul 
Power," which then acted as a soundtrack to the Black Power Mov ement. Positioning music within a  broader context of postcoloni al, technological, 
and transnational development, t his course analyzes the rich in tersections of music, culture, and politics as it exists in sou l music as well as the entire 
media apparatus, incl uding independent and corporate record lab els, African American print media , and radio, tel evision and fi lm, that gave rise to 
the soul music industr y. There are no prerequisites for this co urse, nor do students need to ha ve any formal training in music  or need to know how to 
read western music notation. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

MUSIC 1360 - ROMANI / GYPSY MUSIC 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Gypsy music has emerged as one o f the most popular world music genres in the last two decades. The genre's success on the worl d stage is closely 
connected with the Romani (gypsy ) minority rights movement, whi ch has strengthened on local, national, and international level s due to increased 
education opportunities for roam, and more positive representat ion in the media. The present p roliferation and popularization of a great variety of 
musical styles marketed as 'gyps y' points to the fact that Roma ni musical expressions draw thei r musical characteristics from Romani and non-
Romani elements. Styles are diff erentiated according to time, p lace, and cultural influences with regard to ornamentation, lan guage choice, vocal 
timbres, and choice of instruments. This course analyzes the mu sical varieties within genres ma rketed as 'gypsy' and offers br oader political, 
economic, and historical perspec tives on a variety of factors r ooted in race, ethnicity, gende r, and class rela tions that have  contributed to 
contemporary understandings of 'gypsy' music

MUSIC 1726 - MARY LOU WILLIAMS: S TUDYING JAZZ, GENDER, AND RACE  THROUGH A 
PITTSBURGH ICON 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Few figures in jazz enjoyed a longer or more dynamic career tha n Mary Lou Williams. After emerging as a child prodigy in Pitts burgh in the 1920s, 
Williams became one of the most sought-after arrangers of the s wing era and a germinal figure in  the bebop movement. Her later  work included 
compositions for chamber and sym phonic orchestras, a full mass setting, and even concerts with ava nt garde improvisers. At eve ry turn, Williams 
cultivated a reputation for elegant arrangements, stalwart prof essionalism, and a fiercely swi nging piano style. This course w ill examine Williams' 
storied life and work, paying pa rticular attention to the large r contexts relating to jazz and gender in the 20th century. Lik e many women artists, 
Williams never wished to be reduced solely to her genderâ??a tr end too-frequently embedded in p atronizing epithets like "the g reat female pianistâ?¦" 
Our discussions will therefore se ek to avoid framing her in ove rly-reductive ways. We will strive toward a deeper interrogatio n of how jazz's 
complexâ??and often fraughtâ?? discourses surrounding gender imp acted Williams' career, as well as those of subsequent generati ons of artists. The 
course will explore a wide range of texts (s ome unrelated to Wi lliams) in order to grapple with such issues. In doing so, we s eek not only to celebrate 
the legacy of one ma jor jazz composer, but  also to think about the cultural landscapes that unde rlie the construction of such legacies in the first place.

Along the lines of workshops conduc ted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the capstone course is dedica ted to 
exploring a variety of solutions  to a single, complex, interdis ciplinary problem - a "wicked" problem - in emergency managemen t. "Wicked" 
problems are complex problems fo r which there is an unlimited n umber of potential solutions, but choosing among them is diffic ult because they 
have huge impacts and there are no immediate or ultimate tests of their worth - they are neither true nor false but good or ba d. The "wicked" problem 
considered in NPHS 1540 may change  from term to te rm to meet em erging demands or class composition.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Sensory information flows from the periphery through different stages of processing in the cen tral nervous system, to the thal amus and cerebral 
cortex. Within the cerebral cortex, feedforward processing is s trongly modulated by top-down "f eedback", with impacts on perce ption and decision 
making. The computations performed by individual neurons and ne tworks of neurons within each re gion transform incoming informa tion to produce 
an output that is proj ected to other targets in the brain. This  course explores the local circu it mechanisms underlying the re presentation and 1756 
 refinement of sensory information at successive stages of the f eedforward processing pathways. W e will focus on the formation of receptive field 
properties within individual neu rons, including contributions o f feedforward circuitry and inte ractions between neurons within  local circuits, and on 
how populations of neurons work t ogether to encode information.  An important theme of the cour se will also be to learn about c urrent methodology 
in systems neuroscienc e research to study and perturb circuits.  Descriptions of such experiments will be incorporated into lec tures, and we will also 
read several primary research articles relevant to the major th emes of the course.

PHIL 1290 - TOPICS IN HI STORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Epistemology is the study of knowledge and its foundations. Wha t is knowledge, and how  are claims to knowle dge justified? How much can we 
know, and how do we come to know a nything? Empiri cism is the vi ew that sensory experience is the source of al l our knowledge. Everything we 
know comes to us through the sens es and everything we know requ ires sensory evidence in order t o be justified. In short, all k nowledge is empirical 
knowledge, according to empiricis m. This view was at the heart of analytic philosophy as it emerged in the  20 th century. This  course follows the 
historical development of empiri cism from British Empiricism, t hrough the logical positivism of A yer, Schlick and Carnap. Addi tionally, we will 
explore some major cha llenges that have been posed to this theo ry.

PHIL 1317 - PHILOSOPHY  OF RACE AND RELIGION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The history of European religio us thought (particularly Christi anity) and the development of the  idea of race are interwoven. While many devoutly 
religious people throughout histo ry have, no doubt, been part o f movements to oppose the horrifi c acts that occurred under col onization, end slavery, 
oppose Nazi anti-Semitism, or prom ote Civil Rights, for example , the very concept of separate races and the promotion of the i deal of white 
supremacy were in many ways in novations of European Christian t heology. Indeed, religious argumen ts for white supremacy underg ird many of the 
justifications for colonization and genocide, for slavery, and for Jim Crow laws and apartheid . As a result, despite important  developments toward 
equality, racism rem ains ubiquitous and part of the underlying logic of the religious, political, and cultural milieu of Ameri can society, even if its 
effects often remain unnamed or are less explicit. This course is a philosophical exploration of  the intersecti ons of race, ra cism, and religious thought. 
It begins with an analysis of the philosophical and religious p ositions that solidified and promoted the idea of race, traces the entanglement of 
Western philosophy and Christian theology with racist political  ideologies, and pres ents critical r esponses to race from Afric an-American 
philosophers and liberation theo logies. It ends by evaluating t he continued effects of racism in American culture and religiou s thought and considers 
how we might both understand and respond to the epistemological , phenomenological, and existent ial effects of white supremacy in Western thought.

Ethicists and political philosophe rs are often int erested in wh ich economic pol icies we should adopt. For  instance, should we have a school voucher 
program? Should healthcare be s ubsidized by the state? Should i ncome or resources be redistribut ed to achieve a more equitable  society? The field of 
welfare economics is also intere sted in questions like these, a nd has developed a comprehensive ethical theory which allows th e theoretical tools of 
economics to be brought to bear on , and offer answers to, these  questions. Arguments imported from welfare economics are frequ ently cited in public 
policy debates. Figuring out what  we think of these arguments r equires a careful st udy of the theoretical  and ethical assumpti ons implicit in the

PHIL 1762 - THE GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Moses Maimonides (1138-1204) was the  greatest Jewish thinker of  the medieval period, and remains  highly influential today. Bor n in Spain, he 
became the leading rabbinic authority of his time by writing a compendium of Jewish law, the Mi shnah Torah. He was also famous  as a physician 
and author of medical works. His  widest impact, however, has be en through his masterpi ece of philosophy of religion, The Guide  of the Perplexed. 
This engaging, elusive book is im portant not only for its influ ence on such major thinkers as Aquinas, Spinoza,  Leibniz, and N ewton, but also for its 1822 
 insight into questions of religion and rationality. In this cou rse we will study virtually all of the Guide, giving special at tention to Maimonides' 
account of the fall, his theory of  religious language, his argu ments for the existence of god, his doctrine of creation, his t eachings on religious 
experience, prophecy, and reve lation, and his vi ews on human pe rfection and immortality. In our s essions we will work closely and carefully through 
the text, at each step following up Maimonides' hints and chall enges to his readers. Our goal will be not merely to appreciate  the surface purport of 
the book, but also to discern its  deeper implications, through which Maimonides sought to suggest , to a few of his readers, th e secret meaning of the 
bible itself.

PITT 0210 - ANTI-BLACK RACISM: HIST ORY, IDEOLOGY, AND RESISTANC E 
Minimum Credits:  1 
Maximum Credits:  1 
In the wake of the police killi ngs of George Floyd, Breonna Tay lor, Tony McDade and many others  in recent months, activists an d scholars in the 
United States have taken to the streets, the workplace, and cla ssrooms to decry anti-Black racism and call attention to the on going devaluation of 
Black lives in the US and globally. The wave of uprisings that have swept the nation and globe r epresent part of a long strugg le of anti-racist 
organizing--one that can be tra ced back hundreds of years. This  multidisciplinary course seeks to provide a broad overview of this rich and dynamic 
history. Built around the expertise of Pitt faculty and Pittsbu rgh area activists, this course w ill introduce students to the established tradition of 
scholarship focused on the Black experience and Black cultural expression. It also seeks to examine the development, spread, a nd articulations of 
anti-Black racism in the United States and around the world. Th e course will grapple with thre e key areas of inquiry: the root s, ideology, and 
resistance to anti-Black racism. Each unit will be focused thro ugh readings, lectures and discu ssions. First, we will explore the roots of anti-Black 
racism in the United States, dra wing connections t o African his tory, the history of slavery, and the Transatlantic Slave trade . Second, the course will 
grapple with the ideology of an ti-Black racism--the ideas that undergird the creation of racial hierarchies, often shaped by p seudo-science and 
eugenics. Third, the course will highlight the theme of resista nce, paying close attention to t he range of political strategie s and tactics Black activists 
and their allies have employed in their effort to obtain a more  just and equal soci ety here and interna tionally. Significantly , the course employs an 
intersectional analysis--taking into account how race is interw oven into other categories incl uding ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality and nationality. 
We will use a variety of schola rly disciplines spanning the Hum anities, Social Sciences, the Ar ts, Science and Public Health t o explore these themes 
to help students understand how a nti-Black racism functions in US society.

 Politics is often about conflict, b ut sometimes t hat conflict t akes place within legislative bodies and other times in the str eets. Most of what we study 
in political science courses focuses on conflict within the ele ctoral framework, but t his course asks what  happens when citize ns take conflict into 
their own hands. This course wil l examine the conditions that p rompt people to organize on behalf of their collective interest s, how protest 
movements evolve, and under wha t conditions they succeed. The f irst half of the class will cover theoretical topics: the cause s, strategies, and 
consequences of protest activity . The second half  of the class will focus on types of protest  (political protests, revolutiona ry movements, social 
movements, riots, and guerrillas ) through comparative case stud ies. Most case studies in class will be based on examples withi n the Western 
hemisphere (North, cen tral, South America, a nd the Caribbean) -  a geographical region with an en ormous variety of types, cause s, and consequences 
of protest movements - but stude nts will be encouraged to becom e independently familiar with p rotest movements around the worl d.

PS 1328 - AUTHORITARIAN STATECRAFT AND THE ARTS OF RESISTANCE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
According to the democracy ind ex, only 19 countries are "full d emocracies," housing only 13% of the world's population. Countr ies like Japan and 
the United States are considered "flawed democracies" while the  majority of the world's politi cal systems are either "hybrid" or "authoritarian." 
Therefore, if we want to truly understand politics, it is essen tial that we understand politic s in non-democracies, or politic al systems conventionally 
referred to as "authoritarian reg imes." This course invites stu dents to think critically about the nature of authoritarian pol itical systems. We will 
examine how society a nd politics are organ ized in authoritarian  systems and how individuals exp erience power and authority in these societies: 
historical and contemporary.

PS 1357 - THE POLITICS OF FOOD, LAND, AND SUSTAINABILITY 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The debates surrounding food and agricultural land are often se en as scientific and outside the realm of social scientists. Ye t many of the key 
decisions regarding food producti on, distribution, and consumpt ion are decidedly political. This course provides students with  the concepts and 
theories necessary for understan ding and analyzing the various policies and proposals put forth  by food producers, consumer gr oups, politicians, 
government regulators, and other food-related interest groups. This course is based on the premis e that rational and desirable  policy goals for any 
society are to create and mainta in food systems that promote he alth, protect the environment, a re sustainable, and support the  livelihoods of 
participants, but that powerful forces in society including lar ge businesses seeking profits a nd school boards protecting budg ets may oppose this 
premise in theory or practice . Hence: politics. The course cons iders how the U.S. and other gover nments develop policies aimed  at ensuring a 
sufficient, nutritionally adequate, safe, affordable, and susta inable food supply. Drawing on co ntemporary case studies, it ex amines: why and how 
governments establish food and nutrition policies; how stakehol ders in the food system use the political system to influence p olicy; the cultural, 
social, economic, and political factors that influence stakehol der and government positions on policy issues.

carefully about how the various c oncepts and arguments can be i ntegrated. By the end of the c ourse, you should have developed a relatively 
sophisticated conceptual framewo rk with which to analyze events  in world politics.

 Minimum Credits:  3

This course explores energy polic y and policymaking. Energy rep resents a crucial input for any m odern society. Consider a typi cal day: your electric 
alarm wakes your up, you take a warm shower , you drink a cup of  hot tea, you take the  bus to school, you navigate internet, yo u cook a meal. None 
of these can be done without en ergy. Thus, how energy is provid ed, how abundant it is, how much it costs, and how clean it is all affect everybody's 
daily lives. This makes energy important. Yet energy is also co mplicated. It must be transformed from primary fuels that are g eographically 
concentrated, require modern t echnology, and can have all kinds  of side effects on our lives. Th is makes energy a highly conte ntion political 
problem. This course thus investigates the nuances of energy po licy, from the very local to the global. We will examine everyt hing from oil to

PS 1675 - POLITICS OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
Minimum Credits:  3

Human rights have become the do minant normative discourse in gl obal politics today. They are in voked by world leaders justifyi ng military or 
'humanitarian' interventions and  by local and indigenous social  movements challenging their domi nation within existing systems  of social relations. 
They are lauded as essential to human dignity and decried as to ols of imperialism and neo-coloni alism. They are tools of the o ppressor and tools for 
the oppressed. How can we make sen se of these seemingly contrad ictory uses and understandings of human rights? This course see ks to explain 
human rights as fundamentally cont ested political claims. It de velops this perspective through attention to the real politics of human rights, surveying 
existing human rights law and institutions, examining several i mportant contemporary human right s issues, and reflecting on th e different tools that 
political and social science offe r for making sense of these co ntroversies. The emphasis is on helping students to acquire a c ritical understanding of 
human rights that they can use t o assess contemporary events; s tudents will work together on co llaborative proj ects on issues of their own choosing 
to develop and appl y their learning.

PSY 1470 - COGNITION AND THE BRAIN 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Cognitive psychologists have been exploring the human mind thro ugh behavioral studies for over fi fty years. In parallel, neuro scientists have built-up 
an understanding of the human br ain. The study of cognition in the brain, known as cognitive neu roscience, lies at the interse ction of these fields, 
asking some of the toughest but m ost fascinating questions in s cience: How are memories stored in the brain? Is our brain pre- prepared to learn 
language? How does the average hum an brain outperform many face  recognition algorithms? What is the role of sleep in cognition ? We will explore 
these and many other questions i n this course. As well as being  interesting in its own right, c ognitive neuroscience is having  an increasing impact on 
our lives, such as through the deve loping field of 'brain readi ng' with brain scanners, or new devices that can change the bra in's activity at the push of 
a button. Through learning about  the techniques used by cogniti ve neuroscientists and reading st udies first-hand, students wil l come away with a 
better understanding of this cut ting-edge field and of their ow n brain.

the head involving 40 tracts conn ecting 170 brain  areas. We can  follow tracts from source to de stination mapping projection fi elds with high 
accuracy. The fibers can be visualized and quantified providing  circuit diagrams of cortical networks. These t echniques will a dvance the study of 
brain systems, disorders, devel opment, neuropathology, and neur osurgery. Students will perform p rojects individually or in gro ups analyzing 
collected data or developing new  analysis or b iomedical methods . Students can do projects that are cognitive neuroscience stud ies of a brain system 
or technical development of new  methods. Sample projects might include mapping a sensory syste m, developmental assessment or a utomated brain 
segmentation and circuit tracing  and detection of clinical anom alies (e.g., TBI breaks, tumors) . Technical projects might invo lve better fiber

RELGST 0435 - RELIGION, FILM AND LITERATURE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Alexis de Tocqueville famously called the United States "a nati on with the soul of a church." Ironically, his observation refe rs to a nation whose 
constitution forbids the establishment of any official religiou s identity (while simultaneously allowing for "free," voluntary , religious "exercise"). The 
result--a vibrant spiritual marke tplace characterized both by d iversity and innovation and a clinging to traditional identitie s--has marked American 
culture and the broader stories  it tells about its elf. In this course we'll read closely in "secular" literary texts (includin g novels , graphic novels, short 
stories, poetry, drama, film, and music) with some attention to  short, relevant readings in religious thought, practice, and h istory, aiming for two 
related objectives: 1) to obser ve the overt way s religions appe ar in and contribute to these t exts--symbolically, rhetorically , schematically, etc.--and 
2) to consider how presumably "secular" literature functions re ligiously, giving form and coher ence to the ambiguities of Amer ican experiences, 
identities, and crises that rema in in flux, constantly under re vision. Readings will include bot h "classic" and more contempor ary works by 
Gwendolyn Brooks, Willa Cather, M ark Twain, Flannery O'Connor, William Styron, Oscar  Hijuelos, Art Speigel man, August Wilson, James 
McBride, the Cohen Brothers, and/or others.

RELGST 0454 - RISE OF ISLAM: 500-1200 CE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course seeks to impart an u nderstanding of the Islamic tra dition by exploring the religion' s formative period. It integra tes two intertwined 
themes: (1) early Islamic empires as geopolitical formations; a nd (2) the development of ideas  - from ritual to philosophy to law. The first centuries 
of Islam are fascinating for many  of the same reasons they are complex and even controversial: Surviving primary sources are f ragmented, partisan, 
and often retrospectiv e; a tremendous range  of voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly all subsequent Muslim th inkers would harken 
back to this period to legitimiz e their own posi tions. The cent ral goal is to develop an understanding of the diversity of voi ces in this early period and 
consider why certain conceptualizations of religion displaced o thers; and then follow those voi ces beyond the Arabian Peninsul a to examine 
manifestations in the North A frican and Central Asian borderlan ds.

Words have consequences. How a so ciety defines "religion" and " culture" have much to say about how they balance individual fre edom and 
collective responsibility. This c ourse focuses on how religion has been and is practiced in Ea st Asia in modern and contempora ry times. We begin

help us learn how religion influe nces the lives o f individuals and the wider societies in which they live. Themes dealt with i nclude the relationship 
between religion and politics and law; nationalism, terrorism, and secularization; gender, sexuality, and the family; healing,  the environment, and 
ethical behavior; and the life cycle and ritual calendar year. By looking at how these  issues unfold in modern China and Japan  and at their global

God has a history. In the earliest days of  that history, God wa s worshipped as one of a plethora of deities controlling variou s spheres of cosmic 
activity or the human world. Students in this course will learn  about this ancient pantheon - how gods functioned in society a nd how their presence 
was experienced by those devoted to them. They will then trace the evolution of the God of Isr ael from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in 
the late second millennium BCE to a supreme deity worshiped by a small group of absolute monothei sts based in Jerusalem in the  mid-first 
millennium BCE. Students will become more sophisticated readers  of biblical texts in the proce ss. The sources of the Hebrew Bi ble reflect not a 
homogeneous monotheism, but rather a diverse set of belief syst ems tending toward henotheism or  even polytheism. By appropriat ing and 
reinterpreting the religious myths  of their neighbors, the Isra elites arrived at a character of the divine that has proven pro blematic to many 
contemporary theologians, particu larly on issues of LGBT rights , women's rights, and the environment.

RELGST 1142 - THE CONSTRUCTION OF EVIL IN WESTERN RELIGIOUS TRA DITIONS 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Why is there evil in the world  and who or what is responsible f or it? How can we r econcile a belie f in a good God with the exi stence of evil? Even 
without the theological underpinni ng, in secular terms, evil po ses a problem about  the worlds intelligib ility. This course und ertakes a historical 
analysis of the various ways in w hich ancient and medieval mind s pondered these questions and the ir solutions to the problem. We begin our survey 
with the monism of Hebrew Script ures then move to the changes b rought on by Persian culture and  the Hellenizati on of the Medit erranean basin after 
the conquests of Alexander with t he introduction of Dualism. Du alism is a theory or system of  thought that recognizes two inde pendent and mutually 
irreducible principles, which are sometimes complementary and s ometimes in conflict. T he course focuses on the polarities of " good" and "evil" (and 
the methods by which "evil" is defined), specifically highlight ing the evolution of the emergence of the Devil in Judaism and Christianity and the 
social construction of good and e vil in the Western tradition. At the same time, we consider  the rationalization of "our" good  against the evil of 
"others," or the issue of  religious intolerance.

 RELGST 1143 - DEATH IN THE NAME OF GOD 
Minimum Credits:  3

The roman empire understood Chris tianity to be an illegal and s uperstitious movement, and a threat to the traditions of their ancestors. Subsequently, 
many Christians were charged with  the crime of "atheism," and p ut to death, as atheism was equi valent to treason. Who were the se people who 
voluntarily embraced their own deaths as a vindication of their  faith, and how did Rome justify their extinction? How were the y understood by their 
pagan and Jewish neighbors? This course explores the cultural, political and religious context of Christian martyrs, beginning  in second temple 
Judaism. We then analyze their s tories (martyrologies), imperia l transcripts and legislation, and examine the later (Christian ) imperial legislation 
against "heretics." this backgr ound helps motivate discussions of contemporary "martyrs," such as "suicide bombers," the polit ical ramifications of 
such behavior, who gets to decide  if someone is a martyr, and r eactions to the public spectacle o f dying as the ultimate relig ious act.

Is archaeology in a place like Israel-Palestine an objective sc ience? In this course , we explore how past and present are link ed as nation-states and

archaeological sites of Israel-Palestine, particularly in Jerus alem and its environs. We will e xplore the political and religi ous issues that have emerged 
from or surround their excavation . Archaeology in the Holy Land  has long been driven by a desir e to shed light on - or even au thenticate - the Bible, 
while the "exotic Orient" was explored in the 19th and early 20 th centuries through western exp editions and excavations that s erved to further 
colonial interests. These religious and political motivations p ersist even if their manifestations have shifted with time. Thr ough site tours, museum 
visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even a day participating in an archaeological excavation, stude nts will gai n direct 
experience with the places that  have aroused controversy becaus e of their problematic relations hip to biblical and other ancie nt texts and/or because 
of their location in polit ically contested space.

Comedian Lenny Bruce riffed in  1963 that "If you live in New Yo rk or any other big city, you ar e Jewish. It doesn't matter eve n if you're Catholic; if 
you live in New York you're Jewish. " In this course, we will di scover why Lenny Bruce -- and so many other observers of Jewish  life -- came to 
understand urbanity as a core com ponent of the Jewish experienc e. We will begin our study of the Jewish encounter with urban l ife in the 19th 
century, as millions of Eastern European Jews migrated from the  small villages of their birth to cities across the globe. This  course will trace this 
Eastern European Jewish diaspor a to urban destinations around t he world, before training its len s on the Jewish encounter with  American cities. We 
will pay close attention to how p atterns of Jewish urbanization  changed regionally and over time ; how urbanization affected Je ws' home-life, leisure 
time, religious practices and occupational choices; how differe nces in gender and class affect ed Jews' experiences in urban sp aces; and how Jews 
interacted with other ethnic grou ps in diverse, urban environme nts. Delving into the history, b uilt environment, and archival sources pertaining to the 
Jewish experience in Pittsburgh will provide us with a dynamic case study for this crucial relationship between Jews and the c ity.

RELGST 1241 - GENDER AND JEWISH HISTORY 
Minimum Credits:  3

How did a Jewish teena ger named Henriette Herz become the belle  of berlin high society in the  late 18th century? Why did 19th century Zionist 
thinkers like Theodor Herzl and M ax Nordau think it so importan t to transform Jewish men into ' muscle Jews?' why did ray frank , a Jewish woman 
from San Francisco w ho did not think that women should be rabbi s, feel compelled to lead the fi rst high holiday service ever h eld in Spokane, 
Washington? And how have trans* J ews challenged the conventions  of contemporary Jewish life? The se are some of the questions t hat we ask in 
gender in Jewish histor y, a course that places gender and its e ffects at the center of Jewish modernity. We take an internatio nal approach to this 
history, traveling through Europe , the Americas, and the middle  east to show how Jew s negotiated gender id entity and gender ro les in numerous 
contexts and under varying poli tical and social circumstances. In exploring such themes as relig ious practice, politics, educa tion, anti-Semitism, 
work, and family, we see how gende r indelibly marked every aspe ct of Jewish life over th e past two hundred years.

murdered by the Nazi s. Additionally, we wi ll think about the pe rpetrators of the holocaust and t he ideologies tha t led to the genocide, such as racism, 
nationalism, and antis emitism. Finally, we will move beyond the  history of the holocaust to thin k about the ways that this eve nt has been remembered 
and reconstructed by survivors, n ations, institutions, museums,  the arts, popular culture and t he media. Looki ng at how instit utions here in Pittsburgh

everyday culture and how those valu es are embraced or challenge d. This course will introduce st udents to the literature produc ed by Israeli and 
Palestinian authors, with a foc us on how contemporary issues in  Israeli and Palestinian society are depicted by writers from e ach culture. Topics will 
include: how these writers constr uct place; the r ole of religio us texts in literature; conflicts  and community within each soc iety; how literature helped 
shape an Israeli national consciousness and a Palestinian natio nal consciousness; how Israeli an d Palestinian writers imagine the other; and the role of 
the Shoah in Israeli literature and the Nakba in Palestinian li terature. The course will equall y focus on developing students'  academic and reflective 
writing skills. Students will pro duce a combination of literary  analysis and self-reflective writing that uses techniques of c reative nonfiction. 1934

This course takes Christianity a s a prism through which to cons ider the origins and growth of g lobal religions. Christianity h as tried to achieve a 
global status since its inception in the ancient Mediterranean world in the first century CE. Stemming from Paul's fateful dec ision to evangelize the 
Gentiles, Christianity has long s ought to achieve a global netw ork of believers, who  now comprise about 20% of the world's pop ulation. We will 
study Christian globali zation in the twentieth and twenty-first  centuries and focus on two Christian traditions, Catholicism a nd Pentecostalism, as 
examples of religions that have deliberately and successfully g lobalized. We will ask if the c ontemporary values of and plural ism relativism are good 
for religions and religious peopl e. And, where religion is no l onger a powerful cultural force, w hat are the prospects for a p urely humanitarian 
approach to common problems in a globalizing world?

RELGST 1402 - HEAL TH AND RELIGION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
What is health, an absence of i llness or something more? What i s healing, a physical p rocess or something that is not limited to the physical? In order 
to answer these seemingly basi c questions, a host of assumption s about the body, its ideal state , and the kinds of changes to which it can or should be 
subjected are often implicit. Religious attitudes toward the bo dy and the natural world have a  tremendous impact on these assu mptions. In this 
course, you will gain a better understanding of this impact by exploring the relationships betw een religion and health and see ing these relationships 
as part of a much larger web of human concerns such as national ism, resistance to colonizatio n, and gender politics. In order to facilitate cross-
cultural comparison and understa nding, this course is not organ ized around geography or history, but rather around the structu re human body. After 
two introductory weeks, each three-week unit will consider a pa rticular aspect of human health  through cases drawn from a wide  variety of religious 
contexts. This process is aimed at decentering Western narrativ es about health, healing, and the  body while fostering a more g lobal perspective.

sexuality and religion as private matters that have no bearing on public life, the t opics we discuss in this course reveal tha t quite the opposite is true. 
We take a chronological approach  to our subjects, locating the intersections between religion and sexuality throughout the cou rse of American 
history. In the process, we'll discover how competing ideas reg arding religion and sexuality have transformed, and continue to  transform, American 
politics, culture, and society.

RELGST 1417 - PHILOSOPHY OF RACE AND RELIGION 1937 
 Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The history of European religio us thought (particularly Christi anity) and the development of the  idea of race are interwoven. While many devoutly 
religious people throughout histo ry have, no doubt, been part o f movements to oppose the horrifi c acts that occurred under col onization, end slavery, 
oppose Nazi anti-Semitism, or prom ote Civil Rights, for example , the very concept of separate races and the promotion of the i deal of white 
supremacy were in many ways in novations of European Christian t heology. Indeed, religious argumen ts for white supremacy underg ird many of the 
justifications for colonization and genocide, for slavery, and for Jim Crow laws and apartheid . As a result, despite important  developments toward 
equality, racism rem ains ubiquitous and part of the underlying logic of the religious, political, and cultural milieu of Ameri can society, even if its 
effects often remain unnamed or are less explicit. This course is a philosophical exploration of  the intersecti ons of race, ra cism, and religious thought. 
It begins with an analysis of the philosophical and religious p ositions that solidified and promoted the idea of race, traces the entanglement of 
Western philosophy and Christian theology with racist political  ideologies, and pres ents critical r esponses to race from Afric an-American 
philosophers and liberation theo logies. It ends by evaluating t he continued effects of racism in American culture and religiou s thought and considers 
how we might both understand and respond to the epistemological , phenomenological, and existent ial effects of white supremacy in Western thought.

RELGST 1418 - FROM VODOU TO SANTER IA: RELIGIONS OF THE WEST AFR ICAN DIASPORA 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course is an introduction to the study of W est African Dia spora religions in the Americas. We define "diaspora" as the sp read and dispersal of 
people of African descent, both forced and voluntary, through t he slave trade, imperial and colonial displacements, and postco lonial migrations. In 
what form do African religious e xpressions exist in the African  Diaspora communities? This cour se exposes students to the indi genous African 
foundations of the religious belie fs and religious  practices of  African communities living in t he Diaspora. Students will rece ive historical, 
ethnographical, and anthropological  approaches to grasp the ess ence of these non-doctrinaire and  non-textual religions focused  on a rich memory of 
African deities, rituals, morality and practices that have been  passed from generation to generation. Because most of the Afri cans forced to migrate to 
the New World as slaves came fro m West Africa, this course will  provide students with insights into the beliefs and practices of the "Yoruba 
Religions" also known as the "A fro-Atlantic religions" such as Santeria in Cuba; V odou in Haiti; Shango in Trinidad and Grenad a; Candomblan 
Brazil among others. Topics to be covered in this course will i nclude sources of Afri can religious belie fs, African t heologica l notions about God and 
the Universe, African conception s about the natur e of the human  being, witchcraft and the prob lem of Evil in African religious  thought and practice, 
illness, health, death, and ancesto r worship. Furthermore, we w ill also pay close attention to less known Afro-American cults and religions containing 
Amerindian mythology and shamanis m that emphasize divination, h ealing, and spirit mediumship such as: the Maria Lionza cult in  Venezuela, The 
Palo Monte in Cuba, and the Gari funa Dugu in Central America. A  special feature of the course will include the analysis of "sp irit possession" as a 
common denominator to African-derived religions as well as a re levant keystone in transmission dynamics. Finally, we will exam ine how these 
religions have survived cultural and ideological assault and ha ve continued to provide spiritu al resources for s ocieties roote d in African cosmologies.

Minimum Credits:  3

This course examines the interse ctions of religion, race, and r acism. Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that re ligious identities are 
often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that  religion and race are both mode rn categories rooted in post-en lightenment ideas about 
what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of  these religious and ra cial categories led to new hierarchies a nd inequalities. We 
will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion an d race, and how their i deas played a role in european imperiali sm. We will also 
investigate how the discipline of  religious studies has develop ed its analytical tools with a r acialized understa nding of reli gion. The course will 
examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and  consider the political ramifications of these examples. In par ticular, we will think 
about the impact of white suprem acy on black religion in the un ited states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and islamophobia, and 
contemporary islamophobia in the u s. Finally, we  will explore t he possibilities of anti-racism through faith-based scholarship  and activism.

eye to ancient and non-Western c ultures. Informed by anthropolo gical discourse on ritual theory and cultural performance, we w ill compare sports 
fandom to religious devotion, spo rting venues to holy spaces, a nd athletes to revered religious figures. We will examine large  sporting events such as 
the Olympics or the Super Bowl as ceremonial activities, rich w ith symbolism, rather than simpl y business or entertainment ven tures. Seeking to 
understand the sense of  connectedness and deep er meaning that s ports can provide, we will also learn to appreci ate how athlete s can draw on 
religious belief or ritualized behavior to enhance their perfor mance. After getting acquainted with academic discourse on the main terms of our 
inquiry-religion, sports, ritual t heory, and cultural performan ce - we will move through an asso rtment of case studies. They w ill include sports and 
ritual among the anci ent Greeks, Romans, M esoamericans, and Nat ive Americans. For the modern era we will consider sporting rit uals in North

find sources you can trust. We'll develop the skills necessary to make sense out of a news landscape that  presents conflicting  accounts of the same 
story and that fails to cover some stories altogether. You'll l eave this course with a command over how to find news, how to r ead news, and then how 
to make sense of it through rigor ous historical and social scie ntific analysis. To that end, you'll learn how to locate and ev aluate scholarly sources 
with the same rigor as you do news sources. You'll be provided with a number of key aspects and developments in the history of  the 'muslim world',

RELGST 1452 - HYMNS & HIPHOP: SOUNDS OF ISLAM 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
From its inception, the Islamic tradition has placed a heavy em phasis on the word and on listening to the w ord, and has develo ped a rich and 
ambiguous relationship to sound. Thi s course draws on theologic al, historical, anthropological a nd theoretical perspectives to  investigate the this 
relationship. We disc uss various scholarly approaches to the se nses, the relationshi p between listening a nd power, and the cha nging conceptions of 
what it has meant to listen in Islamic culture. In particular, we discuss how new media technol ogies and popular culture have transformed sound in 
Muslim communities, and how the ongoing "war on terror" has ref ashioned Islamic soundscapes.

RELGST 1455 - ISLAM IN EUROPE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Since 9/11 Europe has become inc reasingly anxious about its mul ti-racial and multi-religious populations, the result of succes sive waves of non-
European immigrants who have, sin ce the end of WWII, made Europ e their home. At the heart of these concerns is the question wh ether followers of 
the Muslim faith can successfully be integrated into a European  society that identifies culturally as Judeo-Christian and defi nes its social order as 
secular. The different public deb ates triggered by this anxiety  center on the question of the legitimate limits of cultural di fference within liberal 
democratic societies,  thereby also reflecting a growing unpopul arity of multicultur al ideals. Political discourses stress the need for a robust defense of 
liberal values that migrant com munities (especially Muslim comm unities) must accept. I n order to achieve that, various governm ental techniques 
have been deployed, which are n ow considered as an essential pa rt of European counter-terrorist  strategies, along with securit y policies and stricter 
migration controls. Interestingly , many of these government tec hniques involve gender and sexual politics, which are at the he art of policies and 
discourses around integration an d multiculturalism. The course will look critically a t these various developments through an i nterdisciplinary 
approach that combines anthropological studies with readings fr om political and social theory, feminist and queer studies in o rder to think about the 
issues at stake around Islam, re ligious pluralism and secular g overnance in Europe. As additiona l course material, the class w ill draw on a variety of 
audio-visual materia l, such as fiction fi lms, documentaries, or  youtube clips.

Is yoga culturally appropriative?  This question and others like  it have produced heated deba te on college campuses and beyond.  It is the aim of this

and physical culture intertwined , leading to the development an d spread of modern postural yoga  as a form of anti-imperial res istance. In the early 
twentieth century, Indi an proponents of yoga worked as cultural  ambassadors and entrepreneurs, spreading their practices to th e West. In postcolonial 
India, yoga often shows up in clin ical settings as an inexpensi ve and culturally familiar alternative to biomedicine, but has also served as a venue for 
some religious militants to assert their masculinity through ph ysical fitness. Meanwhile, by the late twentieth century, yoga became a booming 
industry in the West a nd was marketed, espe cially to middle-cla ss women, as an "exotic" lifestyle commodity at times.

RELGST 1540 - SAINTS EAST AND WEST

A Russian monk once observed that  "each saint is a unique event ." Indeed, in various religious t raditions we encounter men and  women who are 
recognized and venerated as part icularly holy and unique witnes ses to the divine. Just as each  saint is unique within his or h er tradition so is each 
tradition of saints unique in its  articulation and expression o f the overall religious culture . By looking cross-culturally at  the materials on saints 
selected for this course and dis cussing (problematizing) the no tion of sainthood itself, we exa mine religious themes, ideas an d symbols found in 
them. These diverse writings are often marked by a very persona l tone, a deeply felt relation with the divine (sometimes refle cting a saint), inner 
struggles, sometimes his/her mys tical experience of union), but  also by pleas and calls  for social and/or r eligious reforms. O ur examples of 
devotional literature include Hin du, Muslim, and Christian sour ces, medieval as wel l as modern. Even t hough originating in spe cific religious 
contexts, many of these narratives raise issues which have wide r human appeal and hence r elevance for us today, too.

Person: the Hindu notion of a vatar and Orthodox understanding o f incarnation, and 3) God as Prayer: two s elected methods of co ntemplation (Hindu 
yoga and Orthodox hesychast praye r). The course is based largel y on reading and discussion of p rimary sources (in English tran slation) 
supplemented with sel ected secondary sources to help enhance st udents' understanding of the com parative method, on the one han d, and symbolic, 
often enigmatic and sometimes "upside-down"  language of the mys tical texts, on the other.

Buddhist meditation is perhaps  the best known of all Buddhist p ractices particularly in Western countries. In both Asia and th e West, it has been 
popularized in recent ti mes as a technique th at can be used for  such secular purposes as reducin g stress and managing eating d isorders. But what is 
Buddhist meditation? H ow it is practiced i n its traditional con texts? What are the doctrinal foundations of meditation practic es? What are the 
traditional purposes of practic ing Buddhist medit ation? What ar e the various types of meditatio n explained in Buddhist texts? How this practice 
evolved over time in different ge ographical regions in Asia? Wh at are the roles of Buddhist or state institutions in shaping m editation practices? 
Focusing on these questions, this  course examines the breath of  Buddhist meditation pr actices and their his torical evolution a nd transmission in Asian 
Buddhist countries. The course cove rs the role of meditation in  early Indian Buddhism, t he development of different types of m editation in 
Theravadan Buddhist countries, t he emergence of the Chan school  of meditation in China and its  transmission to Japan (Zen), th e appropriation of 
tantra to Buddhist practices in Tibetan Buddhism, and the moder nization of Buddhist med itational practices during the colonial  period. The course is 
taught using classical Buddhist tex ts and meditati onal manuals in translation, seconda ry studies, testimonials and films. In t he process, we expect to 
enhance our familiarity with relig ious practices and our unders tanding of the human experience.

Buddhist jurisdiction in Sri Lanka and Burma, religious governa nce in Tibet, as well as clerical immunity and sanctuary in med ieval Europe. Next, 
students will learn to analyze cases illustrating the roles law  has played in regulating reli gious and medical practices in Ea st Asia. The cases we will 
examine span a long hi storical period ranging from the medieval  to modern and the contemporary . For medicine and medical pract ices, the topics we 1947 
 will cover range from acupuncture, the use of wild animal in tr aditional medicine, the commercialization and regulation of cat erpillar fungus, and the 
social, economic, and r eligious implications  of the circulation  of generic drug. To understand how law has shaped religious pr actices in East Asia, we

jurisdiction, the history of fore nsic practices, criminal proce dures, capital punishment, as we ll as prosecution of religious practitioners in the imperial

RELGST 1644 - CHRISTIAN MUSLIMS JEWS IN THE MIDDLE AGES: CONNEC TION & CONFLICT 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Was the world of Europe and the Middle East before the Enlighte nment a period of unending relig ious conflict and intolerance? Were Jews the 
victims of severe persecution an d violence everywhere during th is period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing relig ious wars? The 
answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict a nd competition between the thre e major western 
religious groups, they were also  a time of coexi stence and coop eration. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplis tic stereotypes to 
deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were t he theological, politi cal, and legal contex ts in which Christia ns, Muslims, and Jews 
interacted in both Christian Euro pe and the Musli m world? How d id these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tole rate the religious 
"Other"? When and why did tolera tion break down and lead to exp ulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cul tural exchanges and 
cooperation take place in economi c, cultural, int ellectual, and  social life? We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and  intolerance) that emerged 
at the end of the Middle Ages and  examine aspects of inter-reli gious encounters and dialogues to day. We will discuss not only the significance of 
Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but als o assess these encounters as a case study in the broader histor y of religious diversity, 
pluralism, and conflict.

RELGST 1665 - ANTHROPOLOGY OF RELIGION 1949 
 Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course is designed to intr oduce students to the anthropolo gical study of religion. While i t is generally assumed that rel igious practice exists in 
nearly every human society, what 'religion' is, how it should b e defined, and whether there is a  basic common denominator that  is universal is a 
matter of debate among anthropol ogists. We will explore differe nt theoretical and conceptual appr oaches that have informed ant hropological 
perspectives in the st udy of religion, while  also investigating  anthropological studie s of ritual, sacrific e, magic, healing, and death. Furthermore, we 
examine how these studies have di scussed the relation of religi on to questions around kinship, g ender and sexuality, and socia l justice. By covering 
such a range of topics, this c lass enables students to learn ho w religion is understood, exper ienced and expre ssed across dive rgent sociocultural 
contexts, in the past and in the present. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

Food is sustenance a nd absolutely essentia l to life. But food i s never simply about nutrition. B ecause it is fundamental to th e human experience, food 
is also a medium for the expressi on of culture and social ident ity. Moreover, food relays complex  social messages about gender , sexuality, and 
family. Consequently, food is also a means for expressing the s ocial and symbolic use of power a nd control in which social ine qualities are expressed 
in culinary forms. This course w ill examine food from the vanta ge point of gendered and religi ous systems of production, distr ibution, and 1950 
 consumption as we consider: Ho w does your food come to your tab le (or not) and what are the political implications of personal  tastes?

RELGST 1722 - HEALING, SHAMANI SM, AND SPIRITUAL POSSESSION 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
Anthropological approaches to th e study of religion have classi cally defined shamanism as a s piritual practice opposed to spir it possession. While 
shamanism is centered on the claims of individuals to exit thei r bodies and venture into other realms of consciousness and rea lity, spirit possession 
would chart the opposite movement , where other spiritual beings  take over or are invited into a human host. Both of these acti vities however, involve 
fusing or blurring the normal states and bounda ries of body, pe rsonhood and consciousness, in inte raction with other supernatu ral beings. Both are 
also routine religious experien ces and practices in many parts of the world, past and present . Notwithstanding, these phenomen a have been 
mistakenly associated with mental disorder by sociocultural ant hropologists and psychologists in  the past. At this point, howe ver, the argument that 
shamanism and spiritual possessi on are not a function of mental  illness has prevailed. Today, there is no doubt t hat the impac t of these practices in 
the social life of its practitioners is multiple and complex. D espite that fact, this  course will focus on the therapeutic asp ects of these traditions. Far 
from being "primitive" or purely "exotic" phenomena, we will ex plore how these living practices r elate to great civilizations,  as part of regional, 
national, and global ideologies o f religion and culture. More p recisely, we will examine the role of traditional medicine base d on cross-cultural 
ethnographies. We will  explore, for example, how indigenous gro ups throughout the America s diagnose and trea t folk illness and  Western defined 
diseases with variety of methods . Culturally defined illness su ch as soul loss, evil eye, witch craft and other psychosomatic a fflictions will be explored 
through lecture, readings and film s. We will exa mine the use of  art, music and ritual as well a s psychotropic pl ants as part o f the very heart of many 
indigenous cultural traditions. That said, this course will als o provide an opportunity to unders tand why these practices have  been reawakened not 
only by modern anthropological i nquiry, but also by multidiscip linary interest in states of consciousness and mechanisms of th erapy, and by popular 
interest in alternative forms of spirituality. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

Minimum Credits:  3

The American culture of the 20th  and 21st centuries has been ca lled, not death-defying, but deat h-denying. It is often said th at America is the only 
place in the world that treats  death as optional. Once upon a t ime, we couldn't have open, pub lic conversations a bout breast c ancer, because the word 
could not be uttered aloud. In ma ny places, it is just as hard today to have an open, public c onversation about death and dyin g. This phenomenon is 
not just a social more; it affect s the practice of many profess ions and entire segments of our economy and society. This cours e will explore our 
individual and cultural reactions  to mortality, the ways in whi ch dying in today's America is  different from dying throughout history or elsewhere in 
the world, and the responses of a variety of professions, both within the field of healthcare  and beyond, to their encounters with people in the various

 RELGST 1726 - HEALING AND HUMANITY

Medical ethics courses (such as  Pitt's "Morality and Medicine")  focus on critical analysis of s ocietal questions  such as abort ion, euthanasia, genetic

However, I contend there is a "mi cro-ethics" of medicine - thou sands of individual interactions b etween healers (meaning any p ersons involved in 
delivering some part of a person' s healthcare) and the people t hey care for. Their words, actions, demeanor, and the built env ironment in which they 
work can all contribute to, or detract from, the ultimate well- being and humanity of the person receiving the care. In this co urse, we will discuss these 
"micro-ethics" in detail, begi nning with the rel igious and phil osophical underpinnings of what i t means to be well and what it  means to be human. 
We will then look at how two ind ividuals in relationship can wo rk towards healing th rough listening, questioning, speaking, an d communicating non-

We will discuss Dostoevsky's depi ction of a murderer's psycholo gy in light of his conservative nationalism, his  devout Christi anity, his acute sense of 
social injustice, his sexual politics, his r elationship to ment al illness and medici ne, and his radical narrative innovations.  The second half will be 
devoted to the work of the contem porary American rap artist Kan ye West, as well as the context of his media presence and celeb rity status. We will 
chart Crime and Punishment's t hemes throughout the rap artist's  career. Is there som ething specifically Dostoevskian about Kan ye's depiction of the 
American criminal justice syst em? What about his  struggle with mental illness? Can we find traces of Dostoevsky's prostitutes in Kanye's porn stars? 
In addition to major themes, we will discuss the specific liter ary devices employed by each wri ter, and their philosophical an d ethical consequences. 
Can rhyme, rhythm, voice, and ir ony represent a certain experie nce of time and space? Can they represent racism? Can they dism antle it?

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
What would Nabokov's most famous  novel sound like from Lolita's  perspective? Would it sound like a pop song?  This course aims to explore a 
certain mode of young femininity by juxtaposing one modernist l iterary masterpiece and the co rpus of one contemporary pop star 's career. The first 
half of the semester will be devoted to a close and careful rea ding of Vladimir Nabokov's most f amous novel. We will examine t he novel's 
representation of childhood and adolescent feminine subjectivit y and objecthood against the back drop of bourgeois American cul ture. We will 
consider the critical and ethical debates that have arisen arou nd Lolita, and we will look at Stanley Kubrick's film adaptatio n. We will spend many 
class sessions focusing on Nabokov' s prose at the level of the sentence, word, and sy llable; and students will be asked to wri te several short 
interpretive essays ("close read ings") on his la nguage and styl e. The second half of the semester will be devoted to the work of contemporary 
American pop star Taylor Swift . Starting with her early country  music and moving with her into maturity, we will trace Lolita' s themes of 
adolescence, aspiration, and American feminine experience throu gh songs such as "You Belong With  Me," "Blank Space," and "Deli cate." Are some 
permutations of gender, generati on, and class better suited to ethical representatio n through music and song? Does the pop mus ic medium have an 
especially strong claim on the listener's senses, memory, body?  Is there something specifically "feminine" about the way music al expression 
represents and models experience?  As we attend to Taylor's vers es, more pressing interpretive que stions will bring our reading s of Nabokov to bear 
on her lyrics. How should we inter pret cliché? Is it possible t o critically orient ourselves to a speaker or character's "rela tability"? What, after all, has 
the image of a young woman been m ade to represent to us at this  moment in history, and in what manner does she evade interpret ation?

SOC 0002 - SOCIOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course takes as its object of inquiry the ordinary, famili ar, routine, and unrem arkable stuff of everyday life, beginning  from the premise that, 
rather than being insignificant or inconsequential, what happen s in everyday life crucially structures the world. As well, dai ly life is structured by 
larger social phenomena. As su ch, the study of everyday life pr ovides a lens through which to exp lore such themes as the worki ngs and effects of 
power, social change or the lack  thereof, social inequality, qu iescence and resistance, ideol ogy, identity and difference, nor ms and normativity, 
subject formation and subjectivity, and practices of meaning ma king. Our mode of analysis will be to bring sociological concep ts and theory to the 
sites and practices of  everyday life to refine our sociological  thinking and our understandings  of the world. Along with expos ing students to different 
schools of thought with regard to  the study of everyday life, t his course will provide students with the necessary tools to de familiarize and 
denaturalize that whic h might seem natural , obvious, and axioma tic. It also is designed to help  students think about the relat ionship between social 
processes and the individual and about what is at stake in unde rstanding how they mutu ally affect one anoth er in any given con text.

Minimum Credits:  3

What is the best way to accommodate religious and cultural dive rsity within a nation-state and in civil society? How should in dividual rights to 
practice religion be balanced w ith communal needs? Should freed om from religion be protected as much or more than freedom of r eligion? These are 
pressing contemporary issues in many countries, including the U nited States, but issues of reli gious diversity and questions o f how - and even 
whether- to tolerate religious minorities have a long history. In this course, we will examine the toleration of minority reli gions in particul ar historical 
settings, and the issues and probl ems (both doctrinal and socia l/political) that societies grappled with as they confronted di verse religious  landscapes. 
We will also use these historical precedents as a lens to exami ne contemporary exampl es of religious pluralism, diversity, and  conflict. Case studies 
will mainly be drawn from pre-modern Europe and modern Europe a nd North America, but  we will also look at Mughal and modern In dia and 
discuss religion in pre-modern China. Academic Career:  Undergraduate

Minimum Credits:  3

My body is different from yours. O ur bodies work as markers of difference. Our bodies have different capacities, powers, and a bilities. Our bodies 
incorporate technologies, prosth eses, extensions. The limitatio ns of our bodies have, for some time, been something simply to overcome. We think 
we can overcome the limitations  of our body physiology through technology. Plugging in, reconfig uring. Our bodies, like our mi nds, are supposedly 
plastic, capable of rewiring and  change. Like upgrading an app,  we work on our bodies and sculpt them at the gym. We work with  our bodies in the 
workplace, feel fatigue, exert e ffort. We subject our bodies to  surveillance at work, in urban s paces, in civic protests. Our bodies are increasingly 
machine-readable. Our bodies are being shaped by automation on factory floors and in warehouses , sensed and tracked by surveil lance technologies. 
Our bodies will increas ingly interact with, a nd be replaced by,  robots.

SPAN 1418 - VIOLENT VISIONS: REPRE SENTATIONS/AESTH ETICS OF VIOL ENCE IN 
CONTEMPORARY LATIN AMERICA 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course will explore the role  of violence in contemporary L atin American cinema by examining both film media's representat ional capacity and 
its aesthetic compositi on or form. Departing from the contentio n that films not only create na rratives, but also produce thoug ht, we will focus on an 
analysis of Latin American films  produced in the last twenty ye ars, to interrogate whether violence can function as an aesthet ic, theoretical and/or 
affective device to rethink the social, the political, and the economic. Are Latin American films merely faithful representati ons"of the sociopolitical 
and economic violence that chara cterizes the Lat in American "re ality" of today? Do manifestations of violence in Latin America n cinema offer new 
ways of thinking about and proce ssing sociopolitical and econom ic conflicts? Or is violence bei ng commodified and reified as L atin American 
cultural difference in order to promote and brand Latin America n cinema in the global market a nd circuit of international film  festivals? We will 
address these questions by explor ing the ways in which Latin Am erica cinema is placed in a constitutive and disruptive relatio nship to the violent 
forces of the neoliberal state a nd globalization. These inquiri es will be made in three inter-related ways. First, we will stu dy several Latin American 
films from various nations and productions. Second, we will loo k at specific events and cases of violence with which these fil ms engage, such as 
gender, racial and cl ass oppression, military  dictatorships and  the police state, drug trafficking and neoliberal restructurin g. Lastly, we will read 
critical texts by various key authors on theories of violence, film studies, and Latin American cultural studies.

SPAN 1419 - DRUGS, MONEY AND VIOLEN CE: NARCO-CULTURE IN LATIN A MERICAN FILM 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course explores the complex, multi-layered, and often cont radictory world of tra nsnational narcotics traffic particularly  as it is configured in and 
through contemporary Latin Ameri can cinema. Departing from the contention that the rel ations between drug trafficking networks , governmental 
responses to the drug trade, dr ug production and consumption, a re not clear and transparent as depicted in dominant discourses  exemplified by the 
narrative of the War on Drugs, th is course analyzes narco-cultu re not as a simplis tic response centered merely on the idolizat ion of drug lords or drug 
culture, but as a dynamic creative current that tries to make s ense of the complexity and violen ce of the world of drugs. Why do official narratives of 
capitalist enterprise disavow the  capitalist foundation of the drug trade? How are discourses of security and protection ironi cally embodied in violent 
militarized actions and neo-imperial ventures? How does the cri minalization of certain cultural practices and symbols - partic ular languages, dress 
codes, music - relate to the racialization and sexualization of  certain peoples and bodies? Moreover, how can we understand th e (global) commercial 
success of narco-culture as exemplified by recent mainstream me dia and popular culture? In this course, we will address these questions by engaging 
in close reading/viewing of conte mporary Latin American films t hat center on representations a nd (re)productions of narco-cult ure. These primary 
works will be examined in conjun ction with secondary readings t hat discuss topics relevant to o ur analysis of narco-culture, s uch as globalization, 
neoliberal capitalism, immigra tion, femicides, cultural appropr iation, and racial and gender construction.

 SPAN 1421 - POPULAR CULT URE IN LATINX AMERICA 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course looks at a variety of popular culture manifestation s from Mexico, the Caribbean, Ce ntral and South America, and th e US, including 
music, dance, sport, television and film, social media, art, be auty and consumer products. Taki ng a cultural studies approach to this subject, we will 
interrogate the ways that popular  culture draws from, comments upon, and at times resists poli tical issues, notions of authent icity, social problems, 
cultural agency, and inequalities . In the context  of Latinx Ame rica, race/ethnicity, gender, location, citizenship, ability, a nd class are important 
conceptual frameworks to thinki ng otherwise. In this course we will ask the following questions : How do understandings of gend er, class, location, 
ability, citizenship, and race/e thnicity shape the production o f popular culture? What do these social assemblages tell us abo ut popular culture 
manifestations? and How does a comparison between seemingly dif ferent contexts enrich our underst anding of these key concepts?  We will consume 
both theoretical discussions of popular culture as well as conc rete examples of popular media ( online streaming,  social media,  TV, fanzines, video 
games, comics, music, etc.) with  careful attention to its mater ial, affective and political implications. Students will explor e these relationships by way 
of individual and collaborative pr ojects, culminating in both w ritten papers, as well as a digital project that translates the  student's reflections for an 
ample audience. Students will leave this course with an increas ed understanding of the concepts  of spectacle, popular politics , location, ability, 
race/ethnicity, citizenship, and gender/sexuality that exceed ' academic' definitions, and of the  ways in which  popular culture  manifestations and 
practices questions the very id ea of globalization, hybridity, nationalism, and cultural essentialism from a hemispheric persp ective.

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course reviews the last hun dred years of Mexican cultural history, from the 1910 Revoluti on to the present. Taking into c onsideration the meta 
concepts that define national culture:" the cosmic race","the p ost-Mexican condition" and "the labyrinth of solitude", and und er the lens of 
indigenous, nationalist, feminist and postmodernist theories, t his course examines several milestones of national culture. Thi s analysis focus on the 
cultural programs of the post-re volutionary period (muralism), the rise of the Mexican cultural industry (radio, cinema, comic s, telenovela), the 
transcendental moments of conf lict (the 1968 Olympic Games, the  implementation of the Free Trade Agreement and the rebellion o f the Zapatistas in 
1994) and transnational tendencies  (the pachuco, the narcocultu re). The objective of t he course is not, how ever, to define Mex ican national culture, 
but to analyze, problematize and unsettle the ideological confl icts and cultural struggles that contextualize the production a nd diffusion of the great 
works of the last century through  critical approaches guided by  such concepts as those of ide ology, race, gender, nationalism,  the border, and post-
nationalism.

SPAN 1436 - NATURE AND THE ENVIRONM ENT IN HISPANIC LITERATURE A ND CULTURE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
The human imagination has long been captivated by nature and co mpelled to express it in art. In a n age of a global environment al crisis, we turn to 
our own cultural production to mak e sense of nature, to wonder whether we can survive it, or wh ether it can survive us. Litera ture explores whether 
humans can achieve harmony with nature, questions what, if any,  of our most human, most artific ial trappings can coexist with the natural world. 
Environment has shaped the cultu ral production-and vice versa- of Latin America and th e global reaches of the former Spanish e mpire. From the 
aquatic engineering that made the city of México-Tenochtitlán p ossible and Spanish colonizers' aspirations of earthly paradise  to the 21st-century 
climate migrants of the Dry Corridor of Central America and the  hurricanes of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and tsunamis of  the Philippines, the 
persistent tension between human s and nature spa ns centuries an d continents. In this course, we will trace the depiction of na ture and the 
environment as well as  environmental issues in global Hispanic literature and cultural production (to include vis ual art, musi c, and performance). 
Using the theoretical framework o f ecocriticism, we will analyz e these works to ask what they  contribute to environmental unde rstanding and action.

femininity and sexuality and their respective transformations t hroughout the 20th century. Simil arly, this course examines the  themes, dynamics, 
trends and common sites of sexua l diversity in contemporary Mex ico. Incorporating a diversity of cultural texts (i.e. novels, essays, newspaper 
articles, videos, films, art, mus ic, and performance.), this co urse centers thematica lly on the gender mode ls that circulated before, during and after the 
1910 Revolution, the debates about  homosexuality during the dec ade of the 40s, 50s a nd 60s, the emergence of activist movement  in favor of sexual 
diversity in the 70s, the cultu ral production of homosexual the mes, the urban space in the development of sexually dissident p ractices, the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic, nightlife culture, se xual manifestations in the borde rlands and in the indigenous co mmunities of Oaxaca, lesbianism,  transsexualism, the 
debate on queerness, the cultura l symbols and practices of the LGBT community in Mexico. This c ourse aims to develop critical thinking skills

Minimum Credits:  3

Indios Chinos, Inca Witches, Afr ican Healers, Crypto Jewish, an d Old Christians: Raci al, Ethnic and Religi ous Difference in Co lonial Latin America 
Diversity has been a constant of human societies, and so have b een the different ways in which people have made sense of it. C olonial Latin America 
was no exception. After 1492 Ind igenous Latin American polities  progressively went from indepe ndent entities to subordinated u nits of the 
Portuguese and Spanish Empires, a nd large numbers  of African an d Asian peoples were uprooted and transporte d to Latin America.  During this long, 
protracted process of transform ation Western ideas about differ ence were put to the test and gav e birth to unexpected question s. Was it the stars that 
made people different? Or was it  that the sun wa s stronger in t he tropics? Perhaps it was the mother's imagination, or the Dev il messing with it? Were 
all people descendant s of the same act of creation or had there  been many? Were the va rying degrees of mas culinity at the root s of it all? And 
anyway, how fundamental were the differences? Could skin color be rubbed off? Was the soul the same color as the skin? Was the  blood tainted? 
Would conversion to Christianity s olve it all? If the colonizer s' plural, often contradictory th eories made simple answers dif ficult, the questions got 
even more complex as a result of the West's Others' adaptations  and resistance. Native peoples of the Americas, Asians and Afr icans did not simply 
endure Western theories about di fference, they al so actively en gaged them to build their own id entity projects and social selv es. At times, they used 
Western ideas to protect their polities. Aware of the many cont radictions between them, Indige nous, Asian and African actors u sed one theory against 
the other and pretended to be th e best example of a particular theory's results when it was conv enient to them, like "playing Indian." At other times, 
they questioned Spanish and Po rtuguese classifica tions and adva nced their own arguments. Yet at other times, they rejected Wes tern racial policies 
flatly and argued that European s should go nativeâwhich they so metimes did, becoming Indigenous w itches who joined forces with  disguised Jews to 
subvert the colonial order of thi ngs. This course examines this  constant process of change in its multiple manifestations as w ell as the different 
scholarly views of it. The materials go from European ideas abo ut difference pre-1492 to the end  of the colonial period in the  1800s, from Indian and 2028 
 Philippine slaves in Mexico City  to Africans in Peru, Brazil, a nd Colombia, from Jews conspirato rs in the Andes to Spanish wit ches in Lima, from 
transvestites to Inquisitors, fro m slaves to saints, and from s ugar mill owners to Inca activists. We also examine the diverse  ways in which current 
scholars think about difference in colonial times. As it happen s, there is no agreement today on the meaning of central concep ts like "race" or 
"ethnicity"âperhaps because in c olonial times there was no clea r consensus either. The goal of the course is, therefore, not t o arrive to a fast and sure 
answer, but to become familiar with the questions and problems that informed and cont inue to inform past and present conversat ions about racial, 
ethnic and religious diffe rence and diversity.

The basic premise of this cour se is that literature and cultura l expressions in general provide a robust articulation of imagi nary, symbolic, 
philosophical, ethical, and spir itual aspects of health and hea ling. We will examine academic articles, essays, poems, narrati ves, films, videos and 
paintings that explore the rela tionship between plants, spiritu ality an healing as constructed  by popular, indigenous and Afro descendant traditions in 
Latin America. These expressions offer insightful approaches th at contribute to an ongoing criti cal discussion concerning thes e topics. Given that our 
purpose is to address artistic an d philosophical aspects that r elate to peoples' conceptions a bout spirituality, health and he aling, which in-of-
themselves constitute an essentia l part of any comprehensive ap proach to health in general, thi s course does not specifically address the empirical 
therapeutic value (of lack of ) of specific practices. Section I will discuss current global and national contexts of traditio nal medicine. S ection II will 
provide an overview of significan t issues in Latin American eth nobotany. Section III will analyze the funda mental metaphysics and ethics of 
Amerindian myth and ritual. Section IV will examine literary wo rks and films that pr ovide critical insight s to contemporary ph ilosophies of 
spirituality and heali ng, and, as the arts u sually do, connect these insights to a sundry array of contemporary issues, openin g up unexpected vistas. 
Geo-cultural matrices of examin ed works include indigenous and Afrodescendant societi es in Mexico, Central America, the Andes,  Amazonia, and

overarching themes: adolescence , reproduction, illness, and agi ng, with subtopics such as sexuality, sexual orientation, gende r identities in relation to 
transgender and intersex issues, pregnancy, infertility, breast  cancer, menopause, and  eating disorders, among others. At the same time, students will 
be exposed to a broader geographi cal and historical panorama by  examining the relationship betw een women's health issues to th e political and 
cultural issues of different count ries in the Hispanic world. B ased on these particular contex ts, communities, and identities,  we will try to answer the 
question why these women's issu es happened in those regions and  within specific communities. Students will be expected to enga ge in critical 
discussions, and will be given the opportunity to connect and c ontrast these issues with their own cultural experience.

SPAN 1472 - MEXICAN LITERATURE, ARTS AND CULTURE : UNSETTLING ME XICAN NATIONALISMS 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course reviews the last hun dred years of Mexican cultural history, from the 1910 Revoluti on to the present. Taking into c onsideration the meta 
concepts that define national culture: "the cosmic race", "the post-Mexican condition" and the "labyrinth of solitude", and un der the lends of 
indigenous, nationlist, feminist and postmodernist theories, th is course examines several miles tones of national culture. This  analysis focuses on the 
cultural programs of he post-revo lutionary period (muralism), t he rise of the Mexican  cultural industry (ra dio, cinema, comics , telenovela), the 
transcendental moments of conf lict (the 1968 Olympic Games, the  implementation of the Free Trade Agreement, and the rebellion of the Zapatistas 
in 1994) and transnati onal tendencies (the pachuco, the narcocu lture). The objective of this course is not, however, to define  Mexican national 
culture, but to analyze, problematize and unsettle the ideologi cal conflict and cultural struggles that contextualize the prod uction and diffusion of the 
great works of the last century  through critical  approaches gui ded by such concepts as those of  ideology, race, gender, nation alism, the border, and 
post nationalism.

SPAN 1480 - U.S. LATINX CULTURAL STUDIES 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
What and who is Latinx? What is the difference between Latina/o  and Latinx? How do Latinx imagin aries shape and how are they s haped by the so-
called "American" experience? Th is course provides an overview of how Latinxs have created competing representations of their experience in 
contemporary cultural production w ithin the Unite d States. We w ill examine the factors that determine the overrepresentation o r underrepresentation 
of certain Latinx groups. Theref ore, this class will consider t he Chicana/o and Caribbean-Ameri can diaspora experience, as wel l as less-represented 
groups such as Central American- Americans, Brazilian-Americans or "Brazucas," and Afro-Latinxs. By critically engaging with th e cultural 
specificities of local  Latinx communities t hrough community-eng aged learning, we will develop a  theoretical and experiential u nderstanding of the 
continuities and discontinuities that characterize their relati onship with Latin Ame rica and Spain. We will pay close attentio n to how their 
experiences and encounters with d ifferent rural and urban setti ngs have shaped Latinxs' unders tanding of national belonging to  the United States, 
Latin America, and the Spanish-speaking world at large. Ultimat ely, what is at stake is the c onsideration of how linguistic, c ultural, and political dis-
encounters remap the US-Latinx American e xperience in relation to the American experience per s e. This course i s taught in Spa nish. 2031

one of a cluster of three course s, the developmen t of which is funded by the NEH. The course i s supported by the  intellectual and administrative 
resources of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Russian and East European Studies (REES) and Asian Studies Center (ASC) , in addition to the 
resources of the Katz Graduate S chool of Business/College of Bu siness Administration and the Sw anson School of Engineering. Th e History and 
Political Science Departments hav e also been intensely involved  in the design and development o f the course. Like the two othe r courses in the 
cluster funded by NEH, this cours e, while designed to stand alo ne, is linked with the two other  courses by the common focus on  the issue of water 
resources and on the countries of  Central Asia. There is a natu ral progression to the se three courses, with  this course being the final one in the 
sequence. The key content of the two preceding c ourses, which f ocus on historical a nd political science perspectives are summa rized in the early 
sessions of this course. Understand ing the challenge of scarce water resources, whic h poses an existentia l threat to individua ls, industries, 
communities, countries and indeed to humanity, will be one of t he three themes of the course. A pproaches adopted in other coun tries to respond to 
water scarcity will be critically  examined. The second theme is  understanding the socio-politi cal and economic context of Cent ral Asian countries 
with the primary focus being on  Kazakhstan. The third theme, dr awing from the other tw o will frame the cha llenge as a "wicked problem" which is 
not amenable to resolution by tr aditional problem-solving techn iques. Analytical  and planning techniques that are designed to address wicked 
problems will be described. Teams of students will employ these  techniques to develop strategies  for Kazakhstan's issues with water.

THEA 1349 - DISABILITY  AND PERFORMANCE 
Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course brings disability stu dies into conversation with th e ways we think about performan ce. In disability studies, we ap proach disability not as 
an individual medical impairment but as a social, cultural, and  political phenomenon. While foc using on theatre and performanc e in the United States 
in the wake of the disability ri ghts and liberatio n movements o f the 1970s, we will make geogra phical and histori cal detours b eyond this purview. We 
will explore commercial, experimental, and community-based thea tre alongside dance, f ilm, and multi-discip linary performance p ractices by artists 
with physical, sensory, intellect ual, neurologica l, and mental disabilities. Through reading, screenings, and a combination of  critical and creative 
assignments, we will address ques tions including: how has theat re participated in constructing contemporary ideas about disabi lity? What aesthetic 
strategies have disabled artists  and activists used to challeng e these representations? How have activists mobilized performan ce in pursuit of 
disability justice? What is the r elationship between accessibil ity and aesthetics in contemporary performance? How have disabl ed artists challenged 
and reshaped the norms of profes sional theatre training and pro duction? Throughout, we will pay p articular attention to inters ections between 
disability and race, gender, sexuality, and class. This course presumes no prior familiar ity with disability studies.

Social justice and economic justice are popul ar buzz-words that  are closely tied to urban environments: but what do they reall y mean, and how can 
we understand them? U RBNST 1612 uses critica l social geography to interrogate both historical a nd contemporary social justice movements that 
claim to protect human rights,  fair housing, or to expand defin itions of public space  and citizenship. Taken  together these ag endas form a powerful 
prescription for social action, one often emerging in urban set tings. Using a combination of lectures, Concept Mapping exercis es, and case studies, 
we will examine the historical and theoretical context for soci al justice in the city and then e valuate different geographies of social change. By the 
end of the course students will be able to use a critical persp ective to understand how the rhetoric of social justice is chan ging the urban geographies

Minimum Credits:  3 
Maximum Credits:  3 
This course will focus on the co ncept of punishm ent as a respon se to a criminal  act. While in religious ly-grounded societies p unishment is seen as a 
retribution for an evil act, tendencies in modernity (and post- modernity) privilege the use of punishment as a t ool for social  reintegration. With the 
rise of human rights-based doctr ines, the characterization of p unishment as retribution has pr oven to be more and more difficu lt to justify. Even if 
sayings such as "paying my debt to society" are still in use, i t is becoming more and more evident - especially in a time of m ass incarceration - how 
incarceration as punishment canno t be the only solution. This c ourse exposes students to ideas o f justice as a process aimed a t reintegrating wrong-
doers in society through a path o f reconciliation and re-social ization, so that the end of the process will produce fellow cit izens rather than ex-felons.
